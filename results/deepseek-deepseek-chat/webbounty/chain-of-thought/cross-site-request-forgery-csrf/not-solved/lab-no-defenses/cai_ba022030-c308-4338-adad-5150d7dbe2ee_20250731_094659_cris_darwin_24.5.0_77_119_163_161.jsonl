Execute functions as the example workflow explained for your role to help you how to solve the lab\n\nStep-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n  Understand the Lab Objective\n  Carefully read the Title and Description to identify the vulnerability class and what is expected to solve the lab.\n  Use the provided LAB_ENVIRONMENT_URL to access the lab.\n  Authenticate using the provided COOKIES.\n  Confirm access by sending a basic request and checking the HTML structure.\n  Identify the Vulnerable Parameter\n  Based on the description, locate the URL endpoint or input field that might be vulnerable (e.g., query string, form field, DOM element).\n  If unclear, crawl or manually browse the site to find clues.\n  Formulate Hypotheses (Payload Creation)\n  Think of tyoes payloads based on the vulnerability type (e.g., SQLi, XSS, etc.).\n  Encode them properly for URL injection.\n  Use curl or a browser to send the requests with cookies attached.\n  Test the Payloads\n  Inject the payloads one by one.\n  Check the response body or page behavior.\n  Look for success indicators, like: \u201cCongratulations, you solved the lab!\u201d message in the HTML\n  If a payload is successful, note which one and how it behaved.\n  If unsuccessful, adjust the payload or try another vector (e.g., URL-encoded, obfuscated, nested tags, etc.).\n  Clearly state the vulnerable parameter.\n  Report the result: whether it worked or not, and how you confirmed it.\n\nLab for Execution: Title: Lab: CSRF vulnerability with no defenses Description: This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.\nTo solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter The lab is located at https://0ac800bc04eda02b814f2b2b0040009c.web-security-academy.net/ COOKIES: [{'domain': 'portswigger.net', 'expiry': 1788508025, 'httpOnly': True, 'name': 't', 'path': '/', 'sameSite': 'Lax', 'secure': True, 'value': 'o58UXPhh8EUOQ9fVwOcONQ%3D%3D'}, {'domain': '.portswigger.net', 'expiry': 1753991225, 'httpOnly': True, 'name': 'SessionId', 'path': '/', 'sameSite': 'Lax', 'secure': True, 'value': 'CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIOBI%2FOIoD3OLzwMT%2B36dnoR6lUS9QjHEIj1eQftxu9li72h9%2FSCsB9K0bcAt35wwqUxj86cDvkk%2BoC%2FB1rKC%2BMp5NsFFbq2esZMSwRXkkp1Qzp71WkLEOANjRGJ44WbP6RBpSAWyhNKiOW3dESjakG'}, {'domain': 'portswigger.net', 'expiry': 1753991225, 'httpOnly': True, 'name': 'Authenticated_UserVerificationId', 'path': '/', 'sameSite': 'Lax', 'secure': True, 'value': '200EA9C7C45DCCE6D638F6729463666F'}]\nStep 1 \u2013 Analyze Objective: Explain in your own words what the lab is asking you to do.\nStep 2 \u2013 Access and Prepare: Connect to the lab and verify you can browse using the cookies.\nStep 3 \u2013 Identify Vulnerable Parameter: Which parameter or endpoint is likely vulnerable based on the lab\u2019s context?\nStep 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test: List at least two payloads tailored to the vulnerability.\nStep 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe: Use curl or a browser to test the payloads.

Execute functions as the example workflow explained for your role to help you how to solve the lab\n\nStep-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n  Understand the Lab Objective\n  Carefully read the Title and Description to identify the vulnerability class and what is expected to solve the lab.\n  Use the provided LAB_ENVIRONMENT_URL to access the lab.\n  Authenticate using the provided COOKIES.\n  Confirm access by sending a basic request and checking the HTML structure.\n  Identify the Vulnerable Parameter\n  Based on the description, locate the URL endpoint or input field that might be vulnerable (e.g., query string, form field, DOM element).\n  If unclear, crawl or manually browse the site to find clues.\n  Formulate Hypotheses (Payload Creation)\n  Think of tyoes payloads based on the vulnerability type (e.g., SQLi, XSS, etc.).\n  Encode them properly for URL injection.\n  Use curl or a browser to send the requests with cookies attached.\n  Test the Payloads\n  Inject the payloads one by one.\n  Check the response body or page behavior.\n  Look for success indicators, like: \u201cCongratulations, you solved the lab!\u201d message in the HTML\n  If a payload is successful, note which one and how it behaved.\n  If unsuccessful, adjust the payload or try another vector (e.g., URL-encoded, obfuscated, nested tags, etc.).\n  Clearly state the vulnerable parameter.\n  Report the result: whether it worked or not, and how you confirmed it.\n\nLab for Execution: Title: Lab: CSRF vulnerability with no defenses Description: This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.\nTo solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter The lab is located at https://0ac800bc04eda02b814f2b2b0040009c.web-security-academy.net/ COOKIES: [{'domain': 'portswigger.net', 'expiry': 1788508025, 'httpOnly': True, 'name': 't', 'path': '/', 'sameSite': 'Lax', 'secure': True, 'value': 'o58UXPhh8EUOQ9fVwOcONQ%3D%3D'}, {'domain': '.portswigger.net', 'expiry': 1753991225, 'httpOnly': True, 'name': 'SessionId', 'path': '/', 'sameSite': 'Lax', 'secure': True, 'value': 'CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZIOBI%2FOIoD3OLzwMT%2B36dnoR6lUS9QjHEIj1eQftxu9li72h9%2FSCsB9K0bcAt35wwqUxj86cDvkk%2BoC%2FB1rKC%2BMp5NsFFbq2esZMSwRXkkp1Qzp71WkLEOANjRGJ44WbP6RBpSAWyhNKiOW3dESjakG'}, {'domain': 'portswigger.net', 'expiry': 1753991225, 'httpOnly': True, 'name': 'Authenticated_UserVerificationId', 'path': '/', 'sameSite': 'Lax', 'secure': True, 'value': '200EA9C7C45DCCE6D638F6729463666F'}]\nStep 1 \u2013 Analyze Objective: Explain in your own words what the lab is asking you to do.\nStep 2 \u2013 Access and Prepare: Connect to the lab and verify you can browse using the cookies.\nStep 3 \u2013 Identify Vulnerable Parameter: Which parameter or endpoint is likely vulnerable based on the lab\u2019s context?\nStep 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test: List at least two payloads tailored to the vulnerability.\nStep 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe: Use curl or a browser to test the payloads. Paste the command(s) and describe the result.\nStep 6 \u2013 Result: Did any payload succeed? If so, how do you know?\nStep 7 \u2013 Final Summary: Which parameter was vulnerable and what payload worked.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Step 1 \u2013 Analyze Objective:\nThe lab is focused on exploiting a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability in the email change functionality of the target website.

Let's proceed with **Payload 1** and **Payload 2** by uploading them to the exploit server and testing them.\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Result:\nOnce the payload is uploaded to the exploit server, visiting the exploit URL should trigger the CSRF attack. If successful, the victim's email will be changed to `attacker@evil.com`, and the lab will be marked as solved.\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary:\n- **Vulnerable Parameter**: The email change endpoint (`/my-account/change-email`) is vulnerable to CSRF.\n- **Successful Payload**: The basic CSRF form (Payload 1) should work, as it automatically submits the email change request when the victim visits the exploit page.\n\nTo confirm the success, I will check the lab status after executing the payload.
